259;2160p60 playback after ExoPlayer 2.12.1 update;open;2020-12-14T10:38:05Z;2021-11-15T13:43:05Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/259;78;"@yuliskov 

I now tried 2160p60 playback on a BRAVIA ATV2 (MediaTek MT5891 @ 1GHz) with STubeNext 10.54 with the updated ExoPlayer 2.12.1. Looks much better now, similar to the original YouTube app. There is some minor micro-stuttering every few seconds left.

I wonder which [MediaCodec mode](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/improved-rendering-performance-operating-mediacodec-in-asynchronous-mode-and-asynchronous-buffer-3026207850b2) ExoPlayer operates in. I don't see one being explicitly set by STubeNext. So I assume it operates in `OPERATION_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS`? How about [Tunneled playback mode](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/tunneled-video-playback-in-exoplayer-84f084a8094d)?"

Ever since the past few updates I've been having constant buffering/loading issues. It will buffer and then resume a number of times when watching a video.

Sometimes the buffering/loading is longer and shows an error that says  ""Video source isn't working or correct time."" It then resumes and plays for a bit and then buffers again.

I've tried restarting my device but that didn't fix it.

Anyone else having this issue?"

Other YouTube clients like YouTube Vanced and NewPipe also have Sponsorblock support. Unfortunately there aren't any Android TV YouTube clients with Sponsorblock support which is a shame because unlike on mobile skipping portions of videos on Android TV is tedious due to the limited controls.
Bellow are some links to some information on Sponsorblock that might be useful.

Running the real Youtube app still works OK (subscriptions etc show properly).

I still have the old ""Smart Youtube TV"" app installed as well - web_20210829_10_RC00 - which is a curious version, since I've not updated that since I installed more than a month ago. It's still showing all my subscriptions etc fine (although playing ads) 

Something internally must be broken with the latest version(s).

Additionally - I created a new youtube account and logged in to that - same problem as above (the ""Oops."" error).
Note that the error says ""Try to login again via settings"" - but there is no way in the settings I can see to do that (this is also a new account, so it's clearly not a login problem really).

I also did, in the ""Settings"" under ""Accounts"", the option ""Select on  boot"" - so when I start the app, I can now select one of the 2 accounts I've got each time - presumably this will ""log in"" to that - but it's still showing black-screens for Playlist, History, and Channels and ""Oops"" on subscriptions every time for both accounts."

1724;For 16:10 monitors/displays, custom aspect ratio options, especially 16:8.1 (1.9753:1) needed!;open;2022-07-28T17:11:37Z;2023-07-28T03:04:20Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1724;24;"**SmartTube version:** 15.30
**Device:** X96 Air S905X3 Android TV Box (Android 9 Pie)
**Monitor:** Samsung SyncMaster 933NW+, 19"" 1440x900, 16:10  (with a HDMI to VGA active converter)
**Sample Test Video:** Youtube video named ""FULL HD PM5644 test pattern - 1920 x 1080 60p - 1 Hour with 1Khz sound.""

**Problem:** On 16:10 monitor, standard 16:9 youtube videos seem distorted, as vertically stretched and not proportional.
**Probable solutions:** Adding custom aspect ratio option for editing, or at least a preset AR as **16:8.1 (1.9753:1)** would solve most probably.

I still use an ancient 19"" 16:10 1440x900 VGA Samsung monitor with a Windows PC and a X96 Air S905X3 Android TV Box. When i watch standard 16:9 youtube videos on Firefox on windows PC, the image is proportional and very well scaled. Of course there are approximately ~13mm black bars on top and bottom of the display, which is totally normal and expected. The photo below shows this situation, as you may see the circles, squares are totally scaled:

![000 Windows PC Firefox Duzgun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67484569/181565008-884b5912-61af-4abc-8829-8e6f2d73677f.jpg)

But when i use this same 16:10 monitor on Android TV Box, the YT videos are full screen with no black bars on top and bottom, so the image is NOT proportional and NOT well scaled.  This is also expected, because Android TV Box outputs only 16:9 resolutions such as 1920x1080 or 1280x720. There's no option to select a 16:10 output such as 1440x900 or 1280x800 etc. The vertically stretched image can be seen on the photo below (the distorted figures are obvious):

![010 X96 Air SmartTube Bozuk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67484569/181572167-bf0530d8-f71a-49a2-9fc7-8b9872fda254.jpg)

Then, how will we solve this problem? I know that a lot of people -want to- use their 16:10 monitors with their android Tv Boxes, mostly with HDMI to VGA converters, like me. I searched the web for a probable usage of custom resolutions on android tv boxes, at least with the rooted ones, but to NO avail. So i think the only solution will be using different aspect ratios for the videos. This will not solve the distorted images on TV Box menus, applications, games etc., but we can achieve well scaled images on videos, films at least.

So i checked the Aspect Ratio presets on the SmartTube app, but the available AR options are not the required one for 16:9 videos on 16:10 displays. Yes, there's a ""16:10"" option, but this is for the internal video scaling, just like the others. Choosing it makes an opposite effect on the display and we have black bars on the left and right sides, not up and down, the image seems squeezed from the sides. Choosing a bigger value like ""2.21:1"" makes a higher change than the required, and makes the image more squeezed vertically, the black bars become more wider than needed.

**Then, we need a proper aspect ratio. I think it can be calculated as follows:**
16:10 AR is 10/9=1.1111... times bigger vertically than the 16:9 AR.
To make the opposite effect on the image, we need to divide 9 with that result:
9/1.1111...=8.1

**So we need a custom aspect ratio of ""16:8.1"" (which is also ""1.9753:1"")**

After calculating this result, i checked it with the 2 different android apps; MX Player and KODI.

**MX Player** doesn't have a ""16:8.1"" preset, but has a ""Custom"" option in ""Aspect Ratio"" setting. Editing ""Custom Aspect Ratio"" as ""16:8.1"" (or ""1.9753:1"") fixes the 16:9 video distortion on 16:10 monitor. I get the 13mm thick black bars both on top and bottom of the screen on this particular 19"" 1440x900 monitor, just like the situation in windows PC:

![021 X96 Air MXPlayer AR-16-8 1 Duzgun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67484569/181584390-b4b06bd4-dd34-4fd9-8a0d-7bd4ed68b635.jpg)

**KODI** doesn't have a ""16:8.1"" preset, either. And i couldn't find other AR parameters or a custom AR option. But KODI has a ""**Pixel ratio**"" option in ""Video settings"". Setting ""Pixel ratio"" to ""1.11"" fixes the 16:9 video distortion on 16:10 monitor, on Android Tv Box:  (I guess this ""Pixel ratio"" option may be a universal solution for appropriate image scaling on non-standard displays, I'm not sure though.)

![031 X96 Air Kodi PR-1 11 Duzgun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67484569/181589146-c9e4d87a-af27-4e35-8da7-24d8466460c6.jpg)


So, long story short:
@yuliskov 
Please find a proper solution to this relatively significant inconvenience :

* Add a ""**16:8.1**"" (""1.9753:1"") preset to the Aspect Ratio parameters, at least.
or
* Add a ""**Custom Aspect Ratio**"" to the AR options, where we can enter some specific parameters such as ""16:8.1"" (""1.9753:1"").
or
* Add a ""**Pixel ratio**"" option in video settings, where we can enter some specific values such as ""1.1111"" . (Just like in KODI)
or
* **???**

1007;Is 'Add to Watch later' new additional menu really needed?;closed;2021-10-26T03:16:18Z;2021-12-01T08:35:02Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1007;20;"Please consider reverting 'Add to Watch Later' additional menu from SmartTubeNext 13.31. 
This looks like a redundant setting which annoyingly increased the number of keypressing with additional steps, when you need to choose another playlist. It gets even more disturbing when you need to switch playlists for a video. 

Here's my point:
Normally, prior to this modification, accessing 'Add/Remove from playlist' (from player button or context menu) gets you directly to playlist checklist anyway - where you just have to set or remove ""Watch Later"" playlist - because it's always the first one on the checklist. Is just that simple, and should be enough for this setting. Is almost as short as it can be. One press for the player button and two for the context menu. 
Adding an extra ""Add/Remove to watch later"" now, has no major benefits as shortcut, cause its practically the same number of minimum keypresses (in player).  Instead it's making the access to other lists one more extra menus and selection away every time.
Please reconsider this. It was just fine before this change. 
Thanks

This is happenning to both STN beta/stable apps, but also at any YT app or platform. Including official app, web or mobile interface. Only today history shown, and not a single item older. So this may not be related to STN !    BUT....

This started to happen exactly right after I made a search in STN with ""Today"" selected as a filter (for the first time ever).  Google history account logs shows that right after this filtered (SmartTube made) specific search, no records of Youtube history are kept for more than one day. It's already been a week since then, no improvement.

Since 2022/01/26 I am getting an error asking to send some ""modernclientdata"" file for support. I have the latest beta version 14.04 of STN installed on my AmazonTV Firestick.

The app is still running fine, but the notification appears very frequently and it's very annoying: it pops up even when playing videos on other apps from FireTV, like the movie player of Amazon Prime itself.

Here a picture of the full notification message:

It doesn't have any other side effect that I know, but the notification is too frequent and annoying. Maybe you can fix it via update or maybe recommend to install an older version of STN

Please answer. Thanks in advance.

1029;History not recording;open;2021-11-04T23:58:31Z;2022-06-04T19:24:11Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1029;14;"Hi,

I have only recently started using SmartTubeNext and I have noticed that the history isn’t recording when using STN. It seems to record 4 videos and then when I watch another video it then removes the 4th video.

What’s strange is that all my other history shows from 13th Oct back but I haven’t been using STN for that long. I’ve probably been using it for about a week now. Also if I watch a video half way and come back to it a few hours later it will pick up where it left off but not show in my history.

I’m using version 13.42 beta on an NVIDIA Shield.

Are there any known issues with this?

I've been using SmartTubeNext for a few years as my main YouTube player and so far I've really been enjoying, thank you for the amazing work!

I wondered if it would be possible to add support for chapters in videos (example here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvkTC2xIbeY). Many of the videos I watch are chaptered and this helps a lot when looking for a specific part.

I don't know how it could be implemented exactly, maybe it could be a simple mark on the progress bar to indicate where the chapters at first?

Chapters navigation (aka jumping to another chapter) could be done by adding two buttons on the toolbar, one to go the previous chapter, another to go to the next chapter.

And when jumping to a new chapter, maybe the chapter's title could be temporarily shown above the progress bar, just below the title - or permanently shown if the user chooses so in the settings.

What do you think of this?

Thanks in advance for your answers!"

I really appreciated the feature you incorporated into an old release of SmartYouTubeTV, where it would prompt new installs to install the bridge-app that allowed your FireTV to recognize SmartYouTubeTV as being YouTube itself / send voice searches for YouTube there / launch with the YouTube icon / etc.

When I installed SmartTubeTV, the old bridge updated to redirect to SmartTubeTV which was great :)

However, on a friend's fire stick, I had an issue a while back where after installing / uninstalling / reinstalling SmartYouTubeTV, the bridge app disappeared – as did any notification to install it

Moreover, when more recently I uninstalled SmartYouTubeTV altogether, and installed SmartTubeTV from scratch, I was never given an option to install the bridge app – and thus, the FireTV refused to recognize SmartTubeTV as YouTube

I was at a loss as to what to do, as the bridge apk has no public listing that I could find – be it in the releases for SmartTubeTV, SmartYouTubeTV, or anywhere else on the internet

HOWEVER, after digging through the issues of SmartYouTubeTV, I finally found this issue: https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartYouTubeTV/issues/697

In it, you directly link to the bridge app – https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartYouTubeTV/releases/download/stable/Amazon_SYTV_Bridge.apk

So I was able to download that, install it onto the FireTV, and viola – it worked perfect!

So... basically, I recommend making a public listing for that Amazon_SYTV_Bridge.apk – be it here on this github in the releases, or elsewhere – and / or giving a menu-option in-app to install said .apk within SmartTubeTV

Thank you for your consideration!"

Whatever page ur in the goes blank again and when it comes back on its on the video you were just trying to watch. It's doing this on my android phone and all of my fire tv devices!! Before I had downloaded the update the videos were working, but the were buffering. Like every 3 seconds!!
One other thing that was happening the past couple days to me atleast. Was while watching SmartTubeNext I kept having one specific app that kept loading all on its own. That app was the Peacock app on my amazon fire tv. I do wonder though if any of these issues could be because of Amazon's latest update that the have tinkered with the Developer settings?"

Now it seems that is gone and it's back to the original way which is click on a playlist and it plays the first video, which sucks and really damn annoying. If I want to watch a video in the middle of the playlist I have look at the first row of suggested videos and then hope the video I want to see is listed. I also have to hope they are in the right order, which isn't always the case.

The only thing close to that what it shortly once was is; select the playlist, bring up the menu and select Open Channel which then options the list of video for that playlist. Just two little problems; one is that is oddly worded then, and two it'll always open in a grid. What happened before was that the playlist would list the videos in a row. I wouldn't have too much of a problem with that either way but give an option for it.

Speaking of options, if people want it so they click on a playlist from another channel and it just plays the first video, fine. But then you have people like me that want to see the list of videos. So give everyone that option of what happens when we click the playlist and how that list is displayed.

2650;Smart Tube Application - Black Screen and Buffering Issue;open;2023-06-26T04:33:08Z;2023-08-19T17:15:03Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/2650;9;"Title: Bug Report: Smart Tube Application - Black Screen and Buffering Issue

**Description:**

Hello everyone,

I wanted to bring your attention to a bug that I encountered while using the Smart Tube application. When I open the application for the first time, the videos do not start playing, instead, I am presented with a black screen. Despite having a stable internet connection, the videos continue buffering repeatedly without playing.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open the Smart Tube application.
2. Navigate to any video.
3. Observe that the video does not start playing and a black screen is displayed.
4. Notice that the video continuously buffers without playback.

**Expected Behavior:**

Upon opening the Smart Tube application, videos should start playing smoothly without any buffering issues, given a stable internet connection.

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead, the application displays a black screen and continuously buffers the video content, preventing playback.

**Additional Information:**

1. The issue persists even when I have a strong and stable internet connection, ruling out network-related problems.
2. I have tried closing and reopening the application, as well as restarting my device, but the issue persists consistently.
3. I have verified that other video streaming applications on my device do not exhibit similar issues, suggesting that the problem is specific to the Smart Tube application.

This bug significantly hampers the user experience, as it prevents seamless video playback upon opening the application. I hope that the development team can look into this matter and resolve it as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or if there is anything I can do to assist in resolving this issue.

Thank you.

Best regards,
soumik bose"

Hell, even making it clear you are aware of the issue would make this a little better in terms of the issue being noticed. 

Issue is on a firestick 4k, and it isnt just on mine specifically, all firesticks in the house have the issue. Not even revanced has a buffer issue and that's a modified non ad apk. 

1gb up and down internet, and to top it off, nothing with my internet is blocking your application. It's all clean. Yet the buffer issue has been an issue for a year for me. Sometimes it's less of an issue after certain updates and sometimes its absolutely horrible after other updates. But here's the kicker! Deleting your app after an update that ruined it and downloading a downgraded version does nothing, the issue is just as bad as it was after a broken update. There has to be an underlying issue here but I'd like to know if it's your app or is it google changing things in their api that's fucking with your app... cause this is a headache.. nah, a migraine. 

Acknowledgement would be nice at the very least though. "

I have been using Smart YT TV for a couple of years now, it's very good alternative to the ""original"" YT TV app, but since some releases of the new Smart Tube Next the functionality of the search feature went in a very wrong direction. What I mean is that it's no longer memorizes and lists the previous searches in a vertical list, where was easy to follow and choose from. I would like to ask why did you change this function, as it was so practical and convenient before? Now, with the recent versions of Smart Tube Next I have to input every search, every time again. It was much easier, when it was remembering and showing all my previous searches listed under the search filed. And I would like to ask if there's a possibility to bring back this feature working as it was before?

Hope I was expressing my request understandable and clear, I was tied to clarify as much as possible, but ask if any more clarification would be needed.

1230;Add support for phones that don't have a touch screen. (Low resolution devices.);open;2022-01-18T12:35:00Z;2022-01-27T13:39:32Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1230;8;"I've been using SmartTube on my folder phone which doesn't have a touch screen. And it works really well with the keypad on the phone.

The problem is that my phone has a low resolution, but the thumbnail and UI font(letters) resolution are too high which makes them look blurry. 
![Screenshot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82555878/149937892-78a2e2bb-191c-447a-b65b-24b2b68dadf2.png) ![Screenshot 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82555878/149937948-025423a3-4a3d-44b6-a394-a9c4cea26374.png)

You might say just use YT Vanced. But the UX is terrible on a phone that has a non-touch screen. And plus the microG crashes on my phone so I can't login to YouTube. 
![Screenshot 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82555878/149937915-07f55a36-12d8-4722-8825-f6b06d32206a.png)

So I was wondering whether you could add support for non-touch screen phones. The list below are the things I've been thinking about for better UX on folder phones.

1. Automatically match the thumbnail and UI font resolution depending on the screen size. (or at least give us a option in the settings.)

2. Make the font size bigger for smaller displays.
 ㄴ Earlier I said that the UI font resolution was too high, which make the letters look blurry. But also the font size is too small to read. It would be better if the font size would automatically match or at least could be changed in the settings.

3. Let users change the UI scale up to 2.0x.
 ㄴ The UI scale limit is 1.4x right now. I think it would be better if the UI scale would automatically change or at least could be scaled up to 2.0x.

First, thank you so much for this app, it's gold! It's so life changing compared to the official app!

Since my last update I encounter this bug, here the steps to reproduced it:

_ In my YT preferences (on the official YT website) I chose to deactivate the YT history, the YT history is deactivated and empty

_ When I watch YT on my PC or Mobile the history remains deactivated and empty

_ However, when I watch a video via SmartTubeNext, my history is automatically reactivated and the videos I’ve watched begin to be saved in it

_ The history is then active everywhere (YT PC and mobile), and I have to manually deactivate it again and clear it

_ It remains deactivated until I re-watch a video via STNext again

I didn't have this problem before, but I hadn't updated for several months so I don't know what version I was on before the bug appeared.

Thanks in advance and thanks again for your app!"

I can see that the buffer size drops to 0. Even when buffering for a while, the video is played faster than the TV buffers. I've set buffering to high. Any ideas what do do? The TV is connected via ethernet.

2254;Restore more granular playback speed options ;closed;2023-02-23T09:19:53Z;2023-04-03T16:10:07Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/2254;6;"I'm not quite sure when the change happened since there have been a few updates recently (as of 2/23/23) but as of version 17.20, the speed options have been reduced to only 0.25 increments.

I'm here to request that more speed options be put back because the 0.25 jumps are too big. Going from 1.0 to 1.25 is just too much on some videos. For videos that I want to watch ""naturally"" but reduce the time, more granular speeds between 1.0 and 1.5 are needed. Above 1.5, I think the 0.25 increment is ok.

And I found the previous available 0.95 option really useful for watching foreign language videos that I am learning or have some comprehension of, because it made it easier to decode the words without making it sound unnaturally slow. Below that 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 is ok.

Now for those who thought there were too many options, I also was once annoyed that there were so many options, because clicking and scrolling through the menu was a bit troublesome, especially in the previous UI where clicking the Clock icon would pop up the full menu of speeds and if you were at 3.0x and wanted to go back to 1.0x, you would have to scroll all the way back down. However, I'd made the suggestion (not claiming sole credit) to have single click turn on/off to toggle speed-adjusted playback, and click-hold pop up the speed adjustment menu. When that got implemented, that reduced a lot of cases of having to click through the whole menu because you could go back and forth between 1.0 and selected speed with one toggle click.

I later got the Rii K25 remote control for my Shield (because I was sick of changing batteries on the slim remote) and discovered a great feature: the PageUp/PageDown buttons worked on SmartTubeNext to adjust the playback speed up and down without going into any menu and it was great to be able to adjust speed at any time without having to go into the UI and interrupting playback. So this might be another option for people annoyed with the longer menu, find an alternative remote with PgUp/PgDown keys. Not sure what other remotes work for this but the K25 does.

So please put my vote in for restoring the previous longer list of speed options: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0.

If it needs to be configurable in the Settings, maybe just have a full option list of speeds from 0.25 to 3.0 in 0.05 increments and the user can select the ones they want to appear in the menu."
1943;No chapter support?;open;2022-10-23T09:48:14Z;2023-01-31T05:34:41Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1943;6;"I just downloaded and installed the app, and I was pretty surprised to find out that there doesn't seem to be chapter support. On the stock YouTube app, you can seek left or right, and if you hit the up button, you'll have the ability to easily navigate through all of sections of the video. This is super useful especially for music playlist videos, where you can use it to skip or go back to certain songs. It's also really useful for skipping intros or sections in certain videos.

Given how feature packed this app seems to be, with settings for every single little thing, I'm a little perplexed as to why this functionality would be omitted. It almost makes me think I must be missing something, and the functionality can be enabled in the settings or something. I dug around a fair bit however, and I was not able to find any setting for it.

Are there plans to add this feature in the future? Not having chapters is almost a deal breaker. "

1785;[Feature Request] 'Don't Recommend Channel' in long press menu.;closed;2022-08-15T08:55:45Z;2023-06-29T11:18:15Z;https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext/issues/1785;6;"I love this app, but I've run into an issue that's related to how YouTube handles things from the server side. Its how they differenciate 'Not interested' from 'Don't Recommend Channel' in the algorithm. I'll try to be brief.

YouTube is recommending channels I don't like or want in Smarttubenext. Normally, I handle this by opening the mobile app on my phone, finding a video from the channel, and choosing 'Don't Recommend Channel' from the menu. Recently, the Smarttubenext app on my TV and my other devices are getting different recommendations and I can't do this anymore. 

The result is Smarttubenext's home tab is flooded with recommendations I HAAATE and can't get rid of. And this is also because of server side handling. Choosing 'Not Interested' doesn't flag the algorithm to ignore the channel the video is from, but just that one video. So YouTube's algorithm will systematically feed _Every single video from that channel to me in batches of two to three videos per refresh,_ Presumably until I've blocked every last one individually. To stop a channel from showing up completely, 'Don't Recommend Channel' has to be used. 

Please add 'Don't Recommend Channel' support to the long press menu. YouTube's algorithm is testing my sanity, what little there is. I would be so grateful. "

**Proposed Improvement:** Introduce a default action type setting for every segment type independently. Some users would like to have the button for skipping Intro, Outro, Subscribe and Non-music segments, but automatically skip sponsor and auto-promo segments.

**Current Issue:** If you choose Notification Type ""Confirmation Dialog"" the dialog covers half of the video and darkens the other half. It requires user action to dismiss if a user wants to watch this segment.
**Proposed Improvement:** Instead of the current dialog introduce a non-intrusive semi-transparent ""Skip [segment type]"" button in the lower right corner of the video (with some padding), that appears and highlights itself by default for quick ok-button action, similar to ""skip an ad"" button in original YouTube app. When pressing back button on the remote, this skip button fades away (current behavior for the dialog), pressing any other remote button except ok and back, the normal UI appears, with this button attached to the right side next to the tittle and details, above quality info, and fades away with the UI, but remains there for the length of the segment that can be skipped.
