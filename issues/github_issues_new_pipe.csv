2907;Expandable player with unified UI;closed;2019-12-29T22:12:02Z;2020-08-21T08:56:37Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/2907;356;"Hello!
This is my second attempt in making a PR with unified player. I made conclusions from previous situation and this one should be better:
- less useless code changes like indentation, refactoring of old code, etc
- no files renaming
- no removing of old unsused code

It will help to make a review more productive.

[Youtube screencast of changes](https://youtu.be/963XT36uqNc)

Here is what I'm introducing:
- main, background, popup players now connected via one service, one view, one fragment, one activity and one gesture listener
- main player located in a view with comments, description, etc. So you don't need to open another window for viewing a video. Everything in one place
- playback position is synchronized between players. Easy to switch from one to another
- expandable player at the bottom of the screen with cool animation and additional features like long click to open channel of a video, play/pause/close buttons and swipe down to dismiss
- in-player integrated buttons for opening in browser, playing with Kodi, sharing a video
- better background playback that can be activated in settings. Allows to automatically switch to audio-only mode when going to background and then switching to video-mode when returning to the app
- player service will be stopped automatically when user removes the app from recents
- there are two different bahaviors related to orientation changes: 
  -- with locked global orientation the player will change orientation to landscape and will change it back after onBackPressed() (this method was made previously after @theScrabi requested it)
  -- with enabled global autorotation the player will listen orientation changes and will change UI to fullscreen or default size
- previous features like brightness control, open popup player when going to background, action chooser when clicking on a link, etc are working as expected
- tablet screens are supported too.

There are some bugs that are not fixed yet. Maybe somebody knows how to fix them because I didn't find a solution yet:
- R.id.playQueue can not be scrolled. Actions inside it work but not scrolling. This is related to appbar. Intercepting touches didn't help. This is not a major issue because short playlists can be viewed without problems
- when the player rotates screen orientation programmatically (if global orientation is locked) there is a black flash because of dead activity. It happens not as fast as I want. When orientation rotates with global autorotation enabled there is no such flash.

All unused code I left on the same place and will clean everything after review. 
Thanks everyone for answers in #2882

Hey guys, I happen to notice some new copycats which seemingly violate our [License](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/master/LICENSE).

**Once again, it's OK to copy NewPipe as long as you do not violate our [GPLv3 License](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/master/LICENSE). Please [inform](https://gplv3.fsf.org/) yourself about GPLv3 before forking!!!**

I already mailed some of the copy kiddies, but they seem to not react on it (like always), so my question is how should we handle these copycats in the future?

2309;Feed order and subscriptions groups;closed;2019-04-25T06:56:50Z;2020-04-04T05:13:33Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/2309;142;"- Sort the items chronologically and by type (live, then upload date in descending order)
- Let users group their subscriptions
- Load the feed items in parallel in a background service (like importing works)
- Show the watching count in live stream items
- Use `Groupie` library for easier development of lists

## Demonstration

![demo.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13389907/56712884-7c09ea00-6706-11e9-9527-b0f4afd0c92d.gif)


## Future improvements (follow ups)

- Showing the watching state (progress) in the items
- Migrate other lists to Groupie
- Make localization changes dynamic
- [Maybe] Use the new structure YouTube, it uses JSON which is easier to parse and less error prone

## Use RSS feed for YouTube

**Edit:** Added in the latest updates.

One disadvantage that I found is that it doesn't return current live streams, but maybe that's not a huge problem?

The advantages though are:
- Very lightweight
- Easier to parse
- Available for all (most?) channels

I'll think about it a little more the next few days. Any suggestion/idea is welcome.
 
## Loading Strategy Discussion

There's an issue if we just load everything concurrently: overload on the servers of the services. This can results in errors when doing requests and can put some stress on some services, which we may not want to do it.

I haven't decided what strategy to take here, maybe limit how many channel per second/time period, custom rates for each service, etc.

In the current state, a lower concurrent request rate is used. But in the end, we have to balance two things: services servers load and time to load everything.

Waiting for your opinions on this.

### Expected behavior

entering fullscreen mode

### Actual behavior

see attached [screenshot]

## App
### New
- New application workflow #2907, #4061, #4080, #4130, #4134, #4154, #4155 #4223, #4246, #4272, #4288 (thanks to @avently and all others involved)
  - Unified all three players into one for seamless switching between them - for example, now if you tap on background play while the video is playing in the main or popup player, the stream will start exactly where you left off, not from the beginning. This is true when you go from any of the 3 players to each other.
  - Play video directly in video details screen
  - Option to auto-play video upon opening video details screen (on by default)
  - Swipe down on video to minimize it and continue browsing uninterrupted (in landscape mode, you can swipe down on the title to do the same)
  - Full screen button smartly detects if video is portrait or landscape and behaves accordingly
  - Swipe up on full screen button in landscape mode to scroll down the video details
  - Now you get a neat looking progress bar below the thumbnail in the video details screen if you play it in the background or popup player.
  - Minimize players to background by default when switching app
  - The main player/minimized player retains your browsing history until you close it
- Use MediaStyle notifications for all players #3178

- [x] I am using the latest version - 0.21.8
- [x] I checked, but didn't find any duplicates (open OR closed) of this issue in the repo.
- [x] I have read the contribution guidelines given at https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [x] This issue contains only one bug. I will open one issue for every bug report I want to file.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Use the app to watch videos for a while

I use WebM, if that matters.

### Actual behavior

Eventually, seemingly at random, a video will decide it wants to endlessly buffer on/off, making it unwatchable.

When this happens, I can see that download speed consistently stays at around 60 KB/s. Closing out of the video, clearing cached metadata, then returning to that same video makes it work as normal again, varying between 100 B/s to 1-2 MB/s as you would expect.

### Expected behavior

For one, the app is supposed to buffer at least 25 seconds ahead before playback resumes, as per https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/5516#issuecomment-901382592. Simply enforcing the 25 second minimum probably wouldn't fix the underlying issue, though.

### Logs

Cleaned up to remove screen recorder spam, from the moment I enabled the recorder to the end of the recording. I hope that's enough?

- [x] Feature (user facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
Because YouTube is planning to update their channel page layout (as announced [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIyqEC4V-s)) and divide videos into 3 tabs (regular videos, shorts, livestreams), we need to add this layout to the NewPipe app to be able to access all channel content.

This PR adds a tabbed channel layout with tabs for videos, shorts, livestreams, playlists, featured channels and channel info and a setting to hide certain channel tabs.

#### What is it?
- [x] Bug fix (user facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
Some very small issues were fixed by this PR. 
- I don't like this thing https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/compare/dev...avently:small-fixes2?expand=1#diff-20e0b2ce67b307277c153b396fb79660R355  but making the height anything but wrap content makes red dot in progress bar misaligned on Android 4.4, see #4245. With default height progress bar has smaller touchable area but looks ok on old devices too.
- this thing https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/compare/dev...avently:small-fixes2?expand=1#diff-57eb59a31e38fed8f965fb4a544e3b9fR540 prevents freeze on 4.4. Looks like some devices have even less available size for storing bundle data than Google recommends, see #4230. Anyway, this is how it should work and I'm fine with it
- brightness will be saved in the place where it changes.

#### Fixes the following issue(s)

- all players implemented in one service.
- video player located at the same window as video title, description, related videos, etc. You don't have to switch to another window. Everything in one place.
- popup player supports playlists. Yes, next and previous videos can be selected via popup window.
- easy switching from one player to another. Playing position will be the same. Even current video from playlist will be the same in other player after switching. 
- swipe controls improved. Now you can rewind/forward a video via swipe to the flexible number of seconds/minutes. Also previous brightness value will be saved and used after restart.
- fullscreen and half screen support. If you want to read description while watching a video it is possible now. 
- option in settings which will allow to play an audio while you are hiding the app and using an other app. Video will be disabled and your internet traffic can relax with only audio. Then after returning back to the app video will start working again. 
- autoplaying all videos option. You don't have to click on a play button if you don't want it. This can be done automatically. 
- autoplaying while your phone uses landscape orientation.
- you will see next/previous video buttons only when its needed. 
- if you want to contribute to NewPipe you'll notice how much code was removed and simplified because now all players located in one file. That's insane,  yes.

First part of my redesign.

I added a navigation drawer with all things we need there.
This isn't done yet, I still need to remove the options menu, add a better navigation and add the tabs.

Also, we might want to get different icons for the different kiosks.

In particular, I added another row of controls (below the one containing Add to, Background, Popup and Download), which is shown only when the description is expanded. In #4039 there have been many other solutions proposed, but unfortunately the scrollable-list-of-buttons one would be a nightmare to implement properly while still making it look good on every device.<br/><br/>This PR also removes the description from then dropdown menu and moves it to a tab alongside related streams and comments.<br/><br/>Since tabs were difficult to find out about in the previous version, since some small and almost invisible dots were shown, this PR changes the look of the bottom tab layout.</td></tr></table>

4264;[Feature Request] YouTube's fast forward/rewind behavior;closed;2020-09-10T12:01:37Z;2022-01-30T16:07:15Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4264;80;"#### Describe the feature you want

It's a replacement of the current fast forward/rewind functionality. For a demonstration watch this video (https://streamable.com/e/qhuca0) or see the images below.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6626210/93238849-4691f080-f782-11ea-86e9-51d6052dc663.png)

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it

No.

#### Additional context

When you try the debug ([app-debug-seek-20200915-02.zip](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/files/5226312/app-debug-seek-20200915-02.zip)) then you should keep this in mind:

The current dev branch has problems with seeking for many videos. You can verify it by seeking the seekbar and check if there is a delay (visually). I recommend these two videos for testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTJcASRxbfI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY
They haven't got that great delay and therefore the UI should response better (less jerky) than on most over videos with this build.

#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?
The better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.
Example: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->

<!-- Write below this -->

I think it feels more natural when
- 3 fast taps results in 20 seconds seek instead of 10 seconds + normal click (showControls will be called)
- 4 fast taps results in 30 seconds instead of 20 seconds

I'm looking forward to your opinions ;)"

6895;Selectable behavior of Back button;closed;2021-08-10T19:01:58Z;2022-08-13T17:09:38Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/6895;78;"<!-- Hey there. Thank you so much for improving NewPipe, and filling out the details. Having roughly the same layout helps everyone considerably :)-->

#### What is it?
- [x] Bugfix (user facing)
- [x] Feature (user facing)
- [ ] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
Made an option to change behavior of back button on video fragment. It's something that should be included into initial unified player PR. Now NewPipe users can choose what to do when back button pressed. There are six choices:
- open previous video from history (like now, stays default choice)
- open previous video only in case it was playing from the same playlist as current one
- hide to mini player regardless of what was in the history
- hide into the mini player if the stream was played, close otherwise
- close the player fragment completely but only if nothing is playing or only video is playing. Just hides the player to mini player in case audio or popup are playing
- close even in fullscreen.

Also I noticed that for some reason `equals` check is not working correctly currently. So I reimplemented it based on urls compare of inner streams (see the first commit).

#### Fixes the following issue(s)

#### APK testing 
<!-- Use a new, meaningfully named branch. The name is used as a suffix for the app ID to allow installing and testing multiple versions of NewPipe, e.g. ""commentfix"", if your PR implements a bugfix for comments. (No names like ""patch-0"" and ""feature-1"".)  -->

Additions: 
1. Now Navigation is accessible from both MainFragment, VideoDetailFragment.
2. Added the ""Home"" tab to the drawer to reach home (MainFragment) easily.

I tested this rigorously and there are no bugs I can find. And, I find the app very easy to navigate now :)

If i select an external player, there is a pause followed by an error notification, which I have screencapped and says 'the location.......full screen url....cannot be played'. The fault occurs only on some resolutions, and it has been observed that in most cases the qualities 720p or 360p always work (e.g. https://youtu.be/zCGouRiflIw).

For example videos;

Hi guys, it is me again.

This PR improves upon the previous one in many areas.

Long video descriptions were made properly scrollable (and actually convenient to read!) on TV devices.

NewPipeRecyclerView works much better. The new version is so good, it can actually be used as drop-in replacement for RecyclerView by itself — the separate patched LayoutManager is no longer necessary!

I have identified a bunch of bugs in FocusFinder on various Android versions. Those bugs are no big deal, but they make focus transitions in lists unpredictable if list items have different size (to be precise, when _focusable areas_ have different size). I have implemented a fix in SuperScrollLayoutManager. This is not the same as previous situation, when LayoutManager was necessary to avoid focus loss during scroll — you can now use NewPipeRecuclerView without SuperScrollLayoutManager, having later just improves experience further.

@TobiGr I have tested on Android 9 emulator and found out, why it was hanging for you — it was trying to rotate into portrait mode and apparently failing to do so.

In my experience, real Android TV devices have patched framework classes, that make switching to portrait mode utterly impossible (both automatically and manually). Android emulator does not contain those fixes, so when running on it the player still tried to enter portrait mode... This is not really problem with NewPipe or my changes, — just emulator doing poor job at emulating Android TV boxes. But I still added a change to use portrait mode for player by default when Android TV device is detected.

In general I don't advise to test this on Android 9 — it has several mis-features, that make NewPipe a pain to use. I will send fixes for those later. For now please test on Android 7 and older versions (most TV boxes don't use Android 9 anyway).

Gigaget wase once a downloader distributed on fdroid. However it is discontinued, tho we copypasted their code into NewPipe, and made gigaget our downloader.
Now we have to get rid of it, since its causing a lot of trouble.
Related issues:
https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/961

https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/315

Maybe we could replace it with a [Download Manager](https://android-arsenal.com/tag/179?sort=created) available on [Android Arsenal](https://android-arsenal.com/tag/179?sort=created). Feel free to browse a little and find a downloader you think fits to NewPipe.

A new download manager must have these abilities:
- using [SAF](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html) (for downloading to sdcard)
- Be singe threaded (one thread per download)

Nice to have:
- Prevent/restrict download on mobile connection

There are 4 different UI to test
- (1) dialog like (default)
- (2) action menu look alike dialog (my favourite)
- (3) action menu (legacy)
- (4) chip dialog

To choose go to settings -> appearance -> 'Select Search Filter UI'

Notes:
- UI (3) is slow but working (slow maybe because of misusing the action menu
##### Feedback needed
- which UIs do you want (to merge)? I would like to keep  1 and 2 and 4. 3 seems to be also liked. So keep them all!. ~~I will then rework the code as there is some duplication right now that should be eliminated first~~ Any duplication has been removed.

- [x] This issue contains only one feature request. I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.

#### Describe the feature you want
In v0.20, full screen button is hidden when automatic screen rotation is enabled in the OS.  
The button should always be accessible, regardless of the system settings.

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
When the device lies on any flat surface and auto-rotate is enabled in the OS, there is no way to play videos in full screen mode without picking the device up to trigger the sensor, or disabling auto-rotate.

#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
A user may want to watch videos without picking the device up. Disabling auto-rotation globally is not an acceptable solution.

#### Additional context
When combined with the manual video rotation control (which should also be restored), this will restore all manual controls that were available in NewPipe before the 0.20 update."

#### What is it?
- [ ] Bugfix (user facing)
- [x] Feature (user facing)
- [ ] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR adds multi-double-tap seeking with YouTube's progress indicator style and a small change to alpha animation handling (dynamic duration depending on the view's alpha value).

I've decided to open this PR to discuss it here even if it isn't merge-ready instead of in the issue since the code base is basically done when #4587 was merged and I've reduced the added code to the minimum.

#### Features
- more polished design with fluid transitions
- indicator which shows the current progress
- multi double-tap-to-seek design that allows seeking faster in one flow

#### To-do
- Apply specific handling for popup-videos due to its variable sizes (triangle icon size and text size)

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
- closes #4264 
- closes #1073

#### Relies on the following changes
In the moment there's a design ""bug"" which results in heavy UI lagging during fast double tapping in some fragments. The reason is that with each seeking the history and playlist fragment is reloaded. Since this feature increases the frequency such high reloading is noticeable.

It could be fixed if the lists fragments apply changes to single items instead of reloading the whole list. But that should be done in another PR, probably by changing to the Groupie library.

#### APK testing (2020-12-01)
When you try it, please make sure you haven't opened the history or playlist detail fragments opened (also in tabs).
[Releases page](https://github.com/vkay94/NewPipe/releases/tag/YT-Rewind-Forward)

Here are some visuals for the 2020-12-01-version with its states:

### Checklist

- [x] I checked, but didn't find any duplicates of this issue in the repo. <!-- Seriously, check. O_O -->
- [x] I have read the contribution guidelines given at https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [x] This issue contains only one feature request. I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.


#### Describe the feature you want
Before update 20.0 there use to be certain buttons in the video player that or now missing. Where the open in youtube button is now, there used to be the background player and pop out button, along with a force video rotation button. The force rotation button was especially useful for watching vertical videos. I know that pop out and background player got moved below the video but it was easier to access these features when watching in full screen mode. Also, the video player doesn't automatically go to full screen in portrait orientation, so if that could be reverted. 




#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
These features are not problems, but a matter of convenience. Instead of leaving fullscreen to access them, there were right on the video player.



#### Additional context
Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here

If you add this back I'll buy the devs big Macs.



#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
This is a useful feature for users who watch videos in full screen mode, as most people do. Instead of exiting the video they can make adjustments from there and not ruin the emersion or viewing experience.

NewPipe is the only app that I downloaded outside of Play Store, so beware guys.

I really have no idea how they can suspend my account since NewPipe isnt even using any Google account information, it only retrieves the video source.

#### What is it?
- [x] Feature (user facing)
- [x] Code base improvement (dev facing)
- [x] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR for devs and for users.

### For devs:

I made optimizations for managing the player service. Now the player service is bound to static class and there is static listener for all events from the player service. VideoDetailFragment can subscribe/unsubscribe from events dynamically without the need to bind/unbind to the service. Fragment only need to subscribe/unsubscribe to/from events via static PlayerHolder. It gives possibility to skip binding process on configuration change and to speed up orientation change.

Also I discovered that `prepareAndHandleInfo` is terribly slow, something around 1 second on slow device. Whenever currently playing item in playlist changes this method is called and freezes main thread for a long time. Ideal choice would be to rewrite some methods that populates view groups but it's hard to do and time consuming task. Instead I call this method (`prepareAndHandleInfo`) after timeout which makes main thread free for some time which allows to start playback on next/prev item in playlists fast.

Also I found that SerializedCache clones every item in it which takes some time (100-200 ms). So I removed that part from fragment and saving playQueue, streamInfo and stack inside static variables.

### For users:
Faster loading time of streams, faster orientation change. 
Also when you have horizontal + vertical + horizontal videos in queue this is what happens:
1. In locked global orientation (portrait):
    - in non-fullscreen mode you play all videos tapping on `next arrow` button and orientation will be the same
    - in fullscreen mode you play tapping on `next arrow` button from landscape video to vertical will change orientation to portrait, then after vertical video will change to landscape again for landscape video.

2. In locked global orientation (landscape):
    - every video will be in landscape

3. In unlocked global orientation:
    - video will be in the same orientation you have your device rotated
    - if orientation is portrait and the video is vertical you will be able to play it in fullscreen (fullscreen button appears).
    - if orientation is landscape and you are watching landscape video it will be in fullscreen without an ability to make it non-fulscreen (you're able to rotate your device to portrait and the video will be in non-fullscreen mode)


If you read correctly you noticed that the player will rotate the video from landscape to portrait and back if you selecting vertical video after/before landscape with locked global orientation. It's useful thing but with a cost. And the cost is wrong size of the video for about 0.1-1 second based on performance of the device. This happens because the app still doing many things in main thread. Mostly because of notifications. Yes, they are terrible slow and nothing we can do in this area except to wait until this PR #3178 will be merged. I hope it fixes the notifications' performance but if not the delay is still acceptable. But even if the notifications will be fast, it doesn't help to reduce the delay to 0 because when orientation changes from one to another there is a delay related to reconstruction of the whole fragment. I made this process faster but the delay is still visible on slow devices.

Here we have two APKs: the first one is what this PR gives. The second one shows what it means to have all notifications disabled. So I just tested with disabled notifications and the app is soooooo fast when orientation changes and between videos in queue. Of course, we still need the notifications but it's just for educational purposes:)

857;version 1.0.0;closed;2017-11-18T14:54:08Z;2020-08-04T06:24:31Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/857;60;"I think after all we accomplished so far we can think about releasing version 1.0.0
There are still several things missing:
- Support for livestream
- Suptitle support
- bookmarks
- homestreaming support

But all in all the impotent functions NewPipe has to offer are implemented, and everything feels sort of like a decent app that supports YouTube. So I think we can now consider to put a 1 at the beginning of our version number :)

Just to remember, my plan or roadmap for NewPipe was to accomplish a good working YouTube support until version 1.0 and a good working multi service support until version 2.0.
So by branding NewPipe with 1.0 we can then focuse (more) on multi service implementation.

what do you guys think about that?

### Steps to reproduce the bug
<!--
1. Go to '...'
2. Press on '....'
3. Swipe down to '....'
-->
0. This is a bug on Android 12 beta 3
1. Open a video in the popup player (it doesn't matter which video or how you open it)
2. Make sure the popup uses the full width of the screen (when in portrait)
3. Open another app below the popup player, go to the home screen or open recent apps
4. Try to interact with the screen below the popup

<!-- If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug. -->

### Actual behavior
<!-- Tell us what happens with the steps given above. -->
All touches to the app/screen below the popup are ignored, because of the following behavior change in Android 12: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#untrusted-touch-events 

### Expected behavior
<!-- Tell us what you expect to happen. -->
The app below the popup responds to the touches.

<!-- Please fill this out when you do not provide a log generate by NewPipe -->

### Workaround
For now this issues can be solved per device by running the following ADB command:
`adb shell settings put global block_untrusted_touches 0`

### Device info

 - Android version/Custom ROM version: Android 12 beta 3
 - Device model: Pixel 3

4039;Regression - Share and other buttons in video details;closed;2020-08-01T12:59:40Z;2021-01-20T19:48:24Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4039;55;"### Version
<!-- Which version are you using? Hopefully the latest! We just told you that above! -->
- 0.20.0

## Problem 
Now that the unified player PR is merged, let me be the first to add a bug to the Unified Player project (https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/projects/17).

We need to find a way to place the Share button back somewhere on the video details page.

Edit: List of buttons reported to be missing:
- Share
- Resolution selector
- Cast to Kodi

List of other possibly useful buttons:
- Play in external player
- Playback speed
- Fit/Fill/Zoom
- Captions
- Mute
- Open in browser

### Solution
~My suggestion was that it could be placed next to the Autoplay toggle.~

From the discussion below:

- How about a left to right swipeable list where the 4 action buttons are? The default visible actions would be the most used ones, and the lesser used ones could be swiped into view, 4 at a time.
- Better would be to allow to rearrange them via long tap and drag.
- I also think it should show as many buttons as possible on that device, e.g. a tablet in landscape will definitely be able to show more than 4 buttons I think.
- Actually, now that I think about it, that right arrow indicator should be present for all form factors, not just TV. We have to let the user know there is something new there, after all. A right arrow beside the download button would be obvious enough to be noticed. Otherwise mobile users would likely not know about this feature until they accidentally swipe sideways in just the right way or read about the feature online.
- Moreover, once the user has swiped left once to access the next 4 action buttons, we should also show a left arrow indicator next to the first action button, as well."

### Feature description

Redesign of Newpipe

### Why do you want this feature?

As a long-time Newpipe user (3x addict), I feel that app needs some refreshment. Maybe this can be a good addition to start.

Searched UX and divided the features into categories.
- Content Source (Trends, Subscriptions, Playlists, History and Clipboard)
- Quick Controls (Next/Previous Content, Rewinding/Forwarding and Play/Pause)
- Video Player Options (Only Audio/Video/PIP, CC, Video Speed, Fullscreen/Mini Player and Video Quality)
- Share, Save and Download
- Settings & FAQ

![Redesign v0 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7979699/214026122-956f6f59-2775-4353-ae1b-587d4428980f.jpg)

I hope this can ignite the refreshment.

- [X] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Affected version

v0.24.1

### Steps to reproduce the bug

This issue randomly occurs for me.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open and play a Youtube video or a few Youtube videos
2. Watch videos until the popup occurs
3. Popup occurs again a few seconds after closing it with the wait button and keeps occurring every time it is closed by the wait button

### Expected behavior

The expected behavior is for the popup to show up when the app is actually unresponsive. The app is fully responsive right before the popup shows up and whenever I close the popup the app is still fully responsive after. 

### Actual behavior

The ""Newpipe isn't responding"" keeps appearing randomly whenever I am watching Youtube videos with Newpipe. I haven't found anyway to reliable reproduce the issue but it occurs randomly for me whenever I am just watching Youtube videos. 

### Screenshots/Screen recordings

### Logs

### Affected Android/Custom ROM version

Android 13 stable

### Affected device model

The problem of IRC is, you have to be connected to see discussions, you can't connect 5 mins later and see previous discussions.

Read the discussion below, we ended up concluding we'd stay on IRC.
The best way if you still don't like IRC and want to have features of a modern communication plateform is to use a bridge through matrix.org (use a matrix client, for example [Riot](https://about.riot.im/), then join ``#freenode_#newpipe:matrix.org``), or XMPP (see https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2965#issuecomment-578209839 and https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2965#issuecomment-592680480).

- [ ] Bug fix (user facing)
- [ ] Feature (user facing)
- [x] Code base improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
1. Use SAF or NoNonsense-FilePicker *everywhere* based on the setting.
2. Don't have `requestLegacyExternalStorage` anymore in the manifest.
3. Only allow NoNonsense-FilePicker for versions below Android 5 and only allow SAF starting at Android 10.
4. Move `SharpInputStream` into NewPipe and add `SharpOutputStream`.
5. Show folder picker in download dialog if no download folder set yet.

I probably need to clean up some code and we should definitely do some more testing.

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
Fixes #3465 and perhaps some others.

39;Orbot support;closed;2015-09-22T19:57:17Z;2016-02-29T20:39:55Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/39;51;"Heya, Mr tinfoil hat wearing privacy guy here.
Could you (perhaps later down the road) add support for orbot? Even though the app is open-source, Google is still receiving querries from your IP and so it'd be nice if newpipe supports orbot.
After all, the main reason of not using Gapps is to avoid Google's data mining.

I'd recommend a dropdown menu ""orbot support"" ""disabled,enabled,forced""
Where forced will not allow a connection to be made unless orbot is running.

7349;Add seamless transition between background and video players when putting the app in background (for video-only streams and audio-only streams only);closed;2021-11-02T19:02:33Z;2022-02-26T16:32:22Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/7349;50;"#### What is it?
- [x] Feature (user facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR makes the app do a seamless transition between main or popup player and background player when putting the app in background (for e.g. when turning off your device or switching to recent apps).

This will only happen **when you are playing video-only streams or audio-only streams** (when there are audio streams available and only video streams with audio, the pause when backgrounding the app will still happen, in order to reduce data usage; in the case when there are only video streams with audio and no audio streams, no pause will happen).

This **doesn't affect the pause which occur when pressing the `Background` or the `Popup` button** (the current player type is destroyed and a new player type is created).

A black video is shown for a few seconds after you come back to the player. It is **intended**, because the video is not fetched when you are in background, to prevent you to spend more data than needed to play the audio. This is the behavior of the YouTube app on Android (for Premium clients only of course).

Note that **livestreams will still fetch the video stream** (because streams we are getting right now are not demuxed (this will probably change soon) and there is an ExoPlayer bug which still fetches video even if it has been disabled with the track selector for HLS contents (the delivery method we can only use for livestreams right now) (a low priority has been given by the ExoPlayer team to this bug)).

This PR makes also the player use video-only streams first (instead of video streams with audio), when possible.

#### What is it?
- [x] Bugfix (user facing)
- [ ] Feature (user facing)
- [x] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This is the rebased #3777, and also contains:
- Setting migration that enables SAF everywhere possible.

Other than that, it is identical to #3777 (by @wb9688):
1. Use SAF or NoNonsense-FilePicker *everywhere* based on the setting.
2. Don't have `requestLegacyExternalStorage` anymore in the manifest.
3. Allow only NoNonsense-FilePicker for versions below Android 5 and allow only SAF starting at Android 10.
4. Move `SharpInputStream` into NewPipe and add `SharpOutputStream`.
5. Show folder picker in download dialog if no download folder set yet.

#### TODO
- [x] ""SAF"" in the UI should be replaced with something more easily understandable for non-Android devs, like ""system folder picker""
- [x] Remove ""some devices are not compatible"" from SAF setting description
- [x] Investigate whether renaming the zip works - it works
- [x] ~~Keeping the setting in the Download menu doesn't make sense anymore~~ implementing a miscellaneous menu is left for another PR
- [x] Investigate ""NewPipe saf Leaks"" - I can't understand why the name changed, but it's not important
- [x] Explain SharpOutputStream
- [x] ""filename.mp4 (1)"" is created instead of ""filename (1).mp4"" - fixed by passing mime type to file picker
- [x] Fix strange behaviour when app loses access to saf download folder
- [x] Reimplement storing import/export path

- [x] This issue contains only one feature request. I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.


#### Describe the feature you want
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.
Example: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*


Optionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.
Example: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->


Please reenable/reimplement the video rotation button. It's missing since the update to 0.20.0

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.
Example: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->

It's not possible to easily view a video in fullscreen in Newpipe anymore while laying on one side in bed or on the couch, floor... 

#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.
Example: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->



#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?
The better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.
Example: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->

It's a hassle to go into Android settings and deactivate the screen auto rotation just to view a video in full screen and to reenable it again afterwards. The button was a very shrewd feature.

4562;Fix opening VideoDetailFragment and much more;closed;2020-10-18T20:18:46Z;2022-08-04T09:48:48Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562;49;"#### What is it?
- [x] Bugfix (user facing)
- [ ] Feature (user facing)
- [ ] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
- Unify all ways of opening the VideoDetailFragment into two methods: `openVideoDetailFragment()` which sends the new data directly to the fragment manager, `openVideoDetail()` which sends an `Intent` received by `MainActivity` which in turn calls `openVideoDetailFragment()`.
- The arguments taken by `openVideoDetailFragment()` have changed: `autoPlay` is not there anymore, and `switchingPlayers` was added to be able to always determine correctly if the function was called as a way to switch players. `autoPlay` is now calculated based on the user's preference, on `switchingPlayers` and on whether there is already a background/popup player running. For more info see [these lines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562/files#diff-7c684dc26bc21808937b0cd7c85de9810279b15b2ba4fdd2e31a0ad2c9e94962R347-R361). This makes it far more clear when the mini player will start playing (I think some situations were handled correcly only by accident before)
- Disable player stream preloading only if the current stream is going to be replaced for sure (see [this](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562/files#diff-b2e369e39e24aea82f68bcb17acd1135173d776a871986ac8ef85ad73e767333R871-R875)). `equals()` was implemented for `PlayQueueItem`s, so that (only) the url is compared when checking them.
- Add `@Nullable` and `@NotNull` to some variables in `VideoDetailFragment`, allowing me to enforce or remove some null checks. Rename `name` to `title` for consistency.
- Remove `static` qualifier from `currentInfo` and `playQueue` in `VideoDetailFragment`: they were never accessed as static members, and having them static caused random problems while replacing the `VideoDetailFragment` with a new instance of itself.
- [Do not force reopen](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562/files#diff-7c684dc26bc21808937b0cd7c85de9810279b15b2ba4fdd2e31a0ad2c9e94962R510-R511) `MainActivity` when sharing something to NewPipe and pressing on ""Show info"". This was introduced in 67d2b9131e7871505454d12dd1d245528b251228 by @yausername while handling urls in comments, but at that point there was no unified player, so probably without that it didn't work. But now everything works good even by keeping the current `MainActivity` instance, and this yields many improvements: opening urls in descriptions in NewPipe now does not erase backstack, nor does clicking `Open details` on queue items, and probably something else. :-D 
- Replace ""Video player"" with ""Show info"" when sharing a video to NewPipe but the background or popup players are running, and thus `autoPlay` would be `false`.
- Handle ""Video player"" in the exact same way as ""Show info"" for streams, i.e. do not start a service just to fetch the info, since `VideoDetailFragment` can fetch data itself without issues.
- When sharing a video to NewPipe and a play button is pressed, replace the current queue instead of enqueueing. Enqueueing can still be achieved opening info and then enqueueing, but enqueueing directly was bad UX since the user would not see what happened.
- When opening NewPipe from scratch but a player is already running, show the bottom mini player #4712
- Make sure play/pause state is preserved when switching players via the specific buttons. Also replace `START_PAUSED` with `PLAY_WHEN_READY` for better consistency (i.e. not inverting twice).
- Move menu listener to switch players from `BackgroundPlayerActivity` to `ServicePlayerActivity`, thus removing a useless abstract function.
- Remove [some unused code](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562/files#diff-01c2c8e04aff70b98bd2a94267e903d313f32a2e1df712a023e56ace95c9bf62R556-R557) in `RouterActivity`
- Refactor `getPlayerIntent()` functions in `NavigationHelper` and removed unused navigation functions.
- Remove testing-only code in [PlayQueue](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562/files#diff-00e000f7dc0e535b7d97ab5d6056c88e7191a7480725fb20ccd4c49e36b4aabc) `reportingReactor` was used to capture and log broadcast events in debug builds. This can be undone if unwanted.
- Remove unused preference `autoplay_through_intent_key` (left there by accident after 2907, probably)
- Some refactoring here and there: fix warnings in `openDownloadDialog`, in `openDownloads`, in `PlayerHelper` and more

@opusforlife2 @Jean757 @shadow00 @nbmrjuhneibkr could you test if the new share behaviour suits you, i.e. #4403?
@AnotherLife @pew-pew could you test if there are no more issues with playback breaking after opening details, i.e. #4541?
@aand18 @Medard22 @UserX404 @ventilaar @floral-qua-floral @Idiotten could you test if this solves #4432, i.e. background playback stopping at random after some (constant) time?

4460;Unified player should be optional, makes the app useless in certain scenarios;open;2020-10-09T09:59:04Z;2023-06-02T20:00:17Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4460;49;"### Checklist

- [x] I am using the latest version.
- [x] I checked, but didn't find any duplicates of this issue in the repo.
- [x] I have read the contribution guidelines given at https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [x] This issue contains only one bug. I will open one issue for every bug report I want to file.

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Add tracks to the background queue.
2. Try playing a video in NewPipe.
3. Background queue is erased.

New ""unified player"" makes the app useless if I want to use background player independently from the video player. I'm filing this as a bug, because this is something that worked perfectly fine in v0.19, but is completely broken now due to some questionable features being implemented in v0.20.  

<!-- If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug. -->

### Actual behaviour
When I have tracks in the background queue (either playing or paused), and then try to watch a video in NewPipe, my background queue (which is valuable user data) gets erased without any warnings. This is default behavior in 0.20. The option ""Ask for confirmation before clearing a queue"" (which is disabled by default) adds a warning (that sometimes doesn't work -  https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4459 ), but does nothing to solve the actual problem. The fact that this option even needs to exist now is a clear indication that current implementation is wrong.

I have music and podcasts in my background queue pretty much 24/7, which means that I can't use NewPipe as a video player anymore without constantly losing my queue. And combined with https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/4458 this means that now I can't even open a video from NewPipe in another player without losing my background queue.

### Expected behavior
There should be an option to use background player independently from the video player, just like in previous versions. These players serve a different purpose, and may be used for very different types of content.

Hi, I think it would be nice if NewPipe was able to play downloaded videos... much like Youtube's ""Save Offline"" feature.
People with phones which do not support playback of WebM might find this very useful!

@ssibb in #3932 also suggested the ability to watch the video file while it is being downloaded, in order to be able to judge the quality without wasting data by fetching the video twice (i.e. for viewing and for downloading). "

#### Description of the changes in your PR

1. Enable auto-rotate and watch a video in landscape
2. Disable auto-rotate while watching the video in landscape

Previously NewPipe would return you to your default orientation, but now you'll remain stuck in landscape and NewPipe's fullscreen button won't do anything no matter how many times you press on it.

With this change NewPipe will remain in landscape mode, but when you press on the fullscreen button it'll correctly change the orientation to portrait.

- [X] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Affected version

0.24.1 (but also saw in 0.24)

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. Start App
2. Wait **or** navigate through subscriptions, select video, etc.
3. Eventually App will crash with a Guru Meditation error
4. Restarting app will cause the same crash within 10-15 seconds thereafter

**UPDATED 6 August 2023 with v0.25.2**
1. Have app running on Wifi
2. Move out of Wifi range, switch to cellular data
3. Wait a varying amount of time
4. a)Whether a video is playing or not, whether the app is foreground or not, the app will crash with a Guru Meditation error
**OR** b) Reload subscriptions or otherwise interact with the app: Sometimes (but not all) app will crash with a Guru Meditation error

or

1. Put phone on Airplane Mode, leave it as such for a few hours
2. Take it out of Airplane Mode, connect to the cellular network
3. See steps 3 and 4 above

Change in behavior: Guru Meditation error no longer goes into infinite loop.  Still steals focus as always but it is possible to swipe dismiss the app and restart.  Usually it will work for a while after one or two restarts and then the problem happens again

### Expected behavior

App used to work great.  Started having this problem with 0.24.  Hoped 0.24.1 would fix it but didn't

### Actual behavior

Regular crashes

### Screenshots/Screen recordings

_No response_

### Affected Android/Custom ROM version

Android 12 4.14.190 - stock, no custom ROM, no root 

### Affected device model

Samsung Galaxy S10+, US T Mobile

### Additional information

Closest relevant recent Open Issue is https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/9163 but my problem doesn't happen immediately on startup.  
Closest Closed Issue is https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/9339
but afaik, there isn't a fix (looked at other referenced Issues)

Steps tried.
1. Quickly backed up database before a crash
6. Deleted cache and data
7. Restarted app 
8. Problem still there
9. Deleted cache and data again
10. Uninstalled app
11. Reinstalled 0.24.1 from the Newpipe website
- Checked F-Droid to see if there was a version there but there wasn't
12. Restored database
13. Problem still there

Delay between app start and crash not perfectly reproducible.  Occasionally it will be stable for a few minutes but once a crash happens, it will repeat 10-15 seconds after every restart for some time after which it will be stable for a little while before starting the quick crash pattern

Problem is not affected by VPN state

Weak correlation with signal strength:  Wifi connections _appear_ to take longer between crashes relative to cellular network.  Can't prove it.  Just an observation.

I don't have the tools or skill to get any bug report beyond the Guru Meditation dump provided in the Logs box"

[NewPipe_0.24.1_RC2.zip](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/files/9938718/NewPipe_0.24.1_RC2.zip) (reuploaded from [this CI artifact](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/suites/9129095010/artifacts/424034330) coming from the corresponding release pull request, #9290)

**Report new issues / bugs here!** bugs which existed in previous versions must not be reported here.

## Known issues

- #9242 - probably fixed by #9109
- #9298
- ⚠️ [YouTube] Shorts and livestreams (including VODs) of most channels are not available in videos listed in channels, due to the separation of them into separate tabs. This issue could be solved **only when channel tabs will be implemented**.

  However, you can use workarounds for now:

  - For feeds, use the dedicated method to fetch them (a.k.a. RSS feeds);
  - For channels: you can use the uploads playlist of a channel to get all its public videos: take a channel ID (**not a username or a handle**), replace `UC` by `UU` at the beginning of the ID and use the resulting ID as a playlist ID (append this ID to a playlist URL like `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=` and then open this URL in NewPipe).

2583;Fast actions from mini info item - UI / UX ideas;closed;2019-08-31T11:26:19Z;2021-08-13T08:27:23Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2583;46;"# Problem
I have been thinking about the long press menu lately, and I realized it is inconvenient because:
1. Entries have no corresponding icon, so our eyes can't distinguish between two entries at the first sight.
2. Entries are not always in the same position on the screen, so we can't use muscle memory. Even though this was partially addressed by #2354 & #2368, the position of entries depends anyway on the menu length.
3. There are too many entries, making the menu too crowded, and there are many requests for new entries (#437 #2198 #2510 #1142).
4. There is no way to select multiple streams and apply an action on all of them.

# Solution
This is the solution I propose, sorry for the bad quality ;-)

![menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36421898/64062305-08607800-cbe5-11e9-97d1-7e9ea0f9a6cd.jpg)

Screen A contains normal info item list. By tapping on the blue *stream* info item we get to screen B. Yes, video info is not loaded, instead the item expands to show some action buttons above and below it! Here is why I think this is a good idea:
- Most of the times when I click on a video I just want to play it, and currently I have to wait for video info to load before being able to play anything (#2306). With this solution it would take less time.
- Video info can be loaded by clicking again on the item.
- Icons are always in the same place (relative to the clicked stream) and with the same icon (no text, as icons are representative enough). This solves problems 1. and 2. above. Also, actions about stream content (play&download) are separated from the specific ones that only use stream info (add-to-playlist, share, delete-from-playlist, set-as-playlist-thumbnail, etc.).
- Since play-actions are displayed where the item was before, and the item is shifted down (see how the above separator is not moved in screen B), one can remember where an option is and double-tap in the correct place directly from screen A. This would take no time.
- Background and popup play buttons can be long-pressed to enqueue (consistent with the video info activity).
- There is place for new actions, in case we ever need them. We would just need to add a button to the bar below the item.

By long-pressing on the blue *stream* info item on screen A, the multiple-select options are shown in the action bar (similar to https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2354#issuecomment-494871457), solving the problem 4. above. By tapping once on any other *stream* info items we can select them, getting to situation C. A tick is displayed above selected items' thumbnails and the action bar is populated with actions about stream content.
The three-dot menu cointains the other actions and also two options useful for selection purposes: ""select below"" and ""select above"", only available in non-infinite lists. These can be considered a replacement to a ""select all"" button, but are more powerful and would solve #2510 #2559. If a playlist is long and is not fully loaded, the ""select below"" button would lazily select all items so that they are loaded only if needed. 

# Feedback
I would implement this but I need feedback both from designers and from users. Would this idea suit your needs? Would it be pleasant to the eye? If you disagree with any of the assumptions I made above, be sure to tell me ;-)

- [ n/a] I did use the [incredible bugreport to markdown converter](https://teamnewpipe.github.io/CrashReportToMarkdown/) to paste bug reports.

All downloads are added as queued when added from share menu or from main application, is this intended behavior? 
It always downloaded as soon as added in 0.14.
I'm assuming i'm not the only one having this issue

I add sometimes 20 to 30 or more videos to download at one time since i just go through my sub feed and download anything that interests me on my wifi, for later watching at work where i have 0 cell signal. Having to go into the newpipe application and manually start each download is a real pain. 

I've tried unchecking the ""queued"" checkbox and it doesn't seem to have any effect whether i do it on a single download or each one. New downloads always start as ""queued"" I was waiting for an update hoping it would be fixed but still have this issue with 0.15.1. An option in the settings at least would be nice since i understand why this would be default behavior in certain use cases, but having no way to undo or change this behavior is kinda counter intuitive.

Assuming this is somehow related to #457 but this behavior only started with 0.15 as a regression maybe?"

It really sucks, because YouTube decides for me what I should watch.

But there is a way to fix it in desktop, by changing site version to 'Worldwide' in the site footer.

It would be great to feature this in the app. As far as I know, a language is set as an url parameter, so you don't even need cookies for this to work.

* Albums (playlists) aren't displayed in profile (channel) view. Depends on TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor#227 / TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor#279. For now, you'll have to find all albums via search.

1004;Local Playlist and Database Normalization;closed;2018-01-17T23:19:54Z;2018-02-12T02:46:18Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/1004;44;"IMPORTANT: Please test this on an emulator since this PR includes a database migration script (that normalizes the watch history table) which is currently irreversible.

 - This PR aims at implementing #870 and is a work in progress.
 - Along with local playlists, this PR also tries to normalize the database schema so stream metadata can be reused. 
 - This allows us to create smart playlists, such as latest unique watch history (#998 is also implemented as part of this) and most watched streams. In the future, we can use this data to experiment with video recommendation using related videos and tags.

Here are some screenshots, which is probably better at explaining the new features. These UI are not final, please feel free provide ideas:

Here's an overview of the new database schemas:

- Streams: contains extracted stream metadata
- Stream History: [FK on Streams] contains timestamps of every replay
- Stream State: [FK on Streams] contains user states of a stream, such as saved progress of streams
- Playlist: contains name of user created playlist
- Playlist Stream Join: [FK on Streams and Playlist] contains what streams are in each playlist

Todos (not in order):
- [x] Bulk add playlist from queues (saving ~2000 videos takes about just under a second on emulator)
- [x] Integrate normalized database to display on history activity
- [x] Simpify history activity to use dialog instead of gesture for deleting entries
- [x] Allow modifiable playlist (i.e. reordering and deleting streams, rename playlist and change thumbnail)
- [x] Add query for wiping stream entries which have no joins with other tables
- [x] Refactor/Improve info InfoItem holders to show additional items
- [x] UI improvements
- [x] Add timestamp recording when streams changes midway (#537), no resuming in this PR 

Future PR:
 - Searchable playlist dialog.
 - Add UI for resuming past videos
 - Add query for list by services, currently throws unsupported exceptions
 - Video recommendations using history statistics and related video

2547;"Sort ""What's New"" page chronologically (latest-oldest)";closed;2019-08-20T18:39:24Z;2020-03-14T18:50:41Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/2547;43;"### Features:
1. Sort `What's New` page chronologically, in latest-oldest order
2. Fetch recent videos from subscribed channels in multiple background threads parallel, this speeds up the download process quite a lot
3. Incrementally insert video items to `What's New` list according to the publish time, so users could see the first meaning paint earlier

### Limitations:
1. Publish time is retrieved from Youtube RSS feeds. This would cost users extra mobile data, though the RSS feed XML files are quite small compared to the Youtube channel video HTML pages (each RSS feed XML file is approximately 1/5 to 1/4 file size of the HTML page)
2. Since Youtube RSS feed provides at most the latest 15 videos from the channel, the `What's New` page only shows the latest 15 videos from each subscribed channel

### Remarks:
I missed the PR TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#2309 at first and had just noticed it implemented the similar chronological sort feature in the middle of the development, but I still decided to create this PR for two reasons.

1. I found that this PR is quite different from TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#2309, for instance feature 3 has not been implemented in TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#2309. I have downloaded the apk of TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#2309 and tried it out, the channel grouping feature is really cool, I think this PR and TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#2309 could complement each other well.
2. Many NewPipe users want the chronological sort feature so badly. This PR is relatively small, maybe it would be easier for other contributors to review and merge

9310;FR: Full width thumbnails aka card view mode;closed;2022-11-06T05:57:55Z;2023-02-11T15:03:50Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/9310;41;"Rationale behind the feature:
When user go through videos, it's not possible to get enough info from title as content creators prefer to include details in thumbnails as such.
- Spec details in tech videos
- Movie names
- News headline
- so on

PR for https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/6087

<!-- Hey there. Thank you so much for improving NewPipe, and filling out the details. Having roughly the same layout helps everyone considerably :)-->

#### What is it?
- [ ] Bugfix (user facing)
- [x] Feature (user facing)
- [ ] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
<!-- While bullet points are the norm in this section, feel free to write free-form text instead of a list -->
This PR adds new List view mode called `Card`. Behavior follows,
- A full width card with thumbnail size 16:9 ratio
- Two line full width title

#### Which screens include the new layout?
- Streams Feed/Trending/Channel details (list)
- Playlists in search and local playlist listing
- Streams inside local playlist

#### Minor code improvement:
Currently we have flags for `gridLayout`, `miniLayout`. Replaced the same with enum. Unified logic to identify the list mode resides in ThemeHelper.

#### Minor improvement for w800 devices
https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/8412
Thumbnail size in grid is small for TV(and tablets). This PR includes a small tweak where size has been increased for w800 qualified devices. As opposed to seeing 6 small thumbnails in TV, user will see 3-4 of em now.


#### Before/After Screenshots/Screen Record
<!-- If your PR changes the app's UI in any way, please include screenshots or a video showing exactly what changed, so that developers and users can pinpoint it easily. Delete this if it doesn't apply to your PR.-->
- Before:
N/A Grid & List have smaller thumbnails

3348;Background play crash;closed;2020-04-03T21:04:14Z;2020-09-10T11:34:38Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/3348;41;"I've had this problem for like half a year and I've expected someone else to have it too and report it, really no one? I'm using android 4.4.4 and (before that update half a year ago) the background player worked just fine. I can use VLC for external player for background and that works, it's just really crusty and I really liked the default background player so I wondered if anyone knew something on this issue. Did it start taking up more ram at that point or something? My device (i9070) only has about 640 megs.

### Version
0.19.2

### Steps to reproduce the bug
Push 'Background' on any video

### Expected behavior
The background play to work as intended

### Actual behaviour
The onscreen message ""Playing in background"" appears, and never goes away until the app has crashed.
The background player notification appears, but with the video duration and elapsed time both showing 00:00, the audio plays for about 15 seconds during which the app slowly grinds to a halt (can't scroll anything or do anything at all). After being fully frozen for a few seconds it crashes with just ""Newpipe has stopped"" no error report thing.

for direct SQLite access and it saves on boilerplate code. 

As for RxJava2, the reason for using it is twofold:
 - It is directly supported by Room persistence and provides instant update (reactive) 
 when the table is changed.
 - It allows easy caching and sharing for web requests, where multiple fragments can
 obtain synchronized results reactively without needing to send multiple requests.
 This is used in subscription and feed fragments where the needed data are extracted
 from the same request.

Here are some screenshots:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/27990524-9d8c1f88-640e-11e7-8538-8366729dedbc.png"" width=""300""/><img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/27990523-9d8a8470-640e-11e7-948b-1d35ca104e7e.png"" width=""300""/>

The feed is the latest stream item of the channel, if it has one.
Please note, the ""1 video"" means that channel has no new videos/streams available.
This requires an UI change that may need to add an additional enum into info item which is
inside the extractor.


In addition, a reactive subscription button is added to the channel fragment:
This button has a debounce(delay) time of 0.5 second to prevent rapid clicking/database change.

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/27990569-f17b7e1c-640f-11e7-8504-4f16841b618e.png"" width=""300""/><img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/27990570-f18953a2-640f-11e7-810b-afa02fccb640.png"" width=""300""/>

However, when subscription list becomes too large, slowdown can occur as each channel sends
a web request to the source (in this case, Youtube) concurrently. Of course, the thread count
can be reduced to a constant if needed.

There are also problems caused by https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/issues/6,
which manifests as multiple subscriptions are the same channel. This is rectified by when
a mismatch with the database entries occurs and the subscription list is re-updated.

Features missing: 
- Rigorous exception handling (activity simply quits when anything other than IOException occurs)

You could download a test APK [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/files/4354794/app-debug.apk.zip).

To do:

- [x] Show the subscribe count and button
- [x] Show placeholder for avatar and banner while loading or when there is none
- [x] Show 'No items' instead of 'No videos'
- [x] Make the queue working again (~though I've no idea how to do that as a tab could contain both streams and playlists~ just for the stream-only tabs)
- [x] Show tab names at the top instead of dots at the bottom
- [x] Clean up the code
- [x] Fix crash when opening item in channel on homepage
- [x] Localize tab names
- [x] Fix location of loading animation and network error

Will there be a channel blocking feature because this feature is really important in my opinion so we won't get any videos from the channels we don't want. 

### Block keywords (@brigglybaile #3571)
I exclusively use this app to avoid spoilers on YouTube however even then it is possible to get the ending/spoilers video no matter how careful I get. Which essentially means that I have to use Chrome YouTube Blocker extension on my pc if I want to watch gameplay or stuff. Is it possible to add a features which blocks videos that have a certain keyword(s)?
Avoiding spoilers is one of the main features of this app and this certainly make it the best YouTube app to use on mobile.

I don't purpose to switch away from github that quickly (maybe not even at all), but the way I'm used to how these companies work is they promise not to change something and F*** it up just a few months later. Just look at our beloved YouTube, and their all mighty awesome new subscription thing.
However weather we switch or not is up to you.

I would be fortified and prepare, so we can switch quickly once the time comes.

## Here are some proposals

### [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | -----------------|
| - biggest alternative to github  | - veeery slow |
| - has a project importer that can import even the issues from github | - confusing/bad UI  |
| | - centralized (runs an Azure) |

### [git.schabi.org](https://git.schabi.org)

| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | -----------------|
| - verry slick | - does not have an auto importer |
| - self hosted (runs on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com)) | - does not support code review |
| - github like UI | |

## Preperation

So I think a step in the right direction for the beginning would be to try swtich our CI to a service that supports platforms other than github.com. Apropose would be [bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/), or [gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/)"

Now in NewPipe each channel have only one video in the ""What's New"" feed even if they published 10 videos recently ""say 1 day ago"" at the same time only one will show up in ""What's New"", and some other channels that you may subscribed to, haven't published in months and you have watched their videos it still shows them every time you go to ""What's New"".

#### Describe the feature you want
I noticed that some videos on this channel are played with non-English audio track: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSs9x2KzSLhyyA9IKyt4YA (look for the ""Multi-Audio Clip"" ones)

The same video is played in English on mobile YouTube website. Changing the UI language (Settings -> Account -> Language) also changes the audio track language.


#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
Yes. Some videos get played in a language I don't understand, while mobile YouTube web plays them in English by default (at least on my phone, tested on Firefox Klar/Focus with cookies cleared).


#### Additional context
See the channel link above.


#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
This feature will let our users select which language they prefer and watch a video with corresponding audio track. It will also fix the problem I described above.

On home, I'd imagine the same sort of tab interface that the official youtube app has (whatsapp has this aswell), but instead the tabs - since you said this is something you are going for - are different services possibly? Like youtube, vimeo and what not. 
And then just like youtube, have just the icon and the full text above that. 
So youtube has, home trending, subscriptions etc
Newpipe has Youtube, other service, other service etc.

When searching, the results have a tiny grey bar which looks rather not materialish.
The bar should also turn greyish white without the search/options icon when searching. With an arrow at the left pointing left to cancel search.

At the video page, it has a floating play icon in addition to a play icon on the bar. What about having a transparant play icon on the center of the video instead?
And when scrolling down have the video preview remain at the top with the description sliding behind it?
Another possibility is spotify's implementation. (Even nicer) Where the image stays at the top and the content below flows over the image. And the bar is completely transparant.
If you could have a look at the spotify app and scroll down an album you'll know what I mean.
An then have the play button on the image.

#### Describe the feature you want
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.
Example: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*

Optionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.
Example: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->
Until newPipe 0.20.2, while playing a video in background or pop-up mode, sharing another video from others apps to newPipe would enqueue them directly. However this is changing in the upcoming release because it was determined to be bad UX #4562. therefor I am raising this issue to discuss an  alternative for it.

A direct quote from developer:
>When sharing a video to NewPipe and a play button is pressed, replace the current queue instead of enqueueing. Enqueueing can still be achieved opening info and then enqueueing, but enqueueing directly was bad UX since the user would not see what happened.

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.
Example: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->
These are my related conversations with the developer about this issue: https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562#issuecomment-712496743, https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4562#issuecomment-719837705

To summarize: when a video is shared, enqueueing to pop-up or background mode was done directly, however Stypox suggested an alternative to direct enqueueing by shareing video to newPipe, then opening its details from menu, then long pressing enqueue button... however this was a tedious alternative as it would take too much time and effort to do so compared to old method, especially if multiple videos are to be enqueued.. (you can try enqueueing 5 video yourself to see the vast difference).

also when sharing to pop-up or background mode, users actually do not really want video details... they actually just wants the video to be enqueued... if the users indeed wanted video details they would have choosen the first option (video details). ..more so, it results in wasting data for loading the video details page for each video. 


#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.
Example: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->

The alternative for old enqueueing method should be as easy as the old method (enqueueing directly)..  it sould avoid wasting to much time and data.

@opusforlife2 suggested when the share menu appears, long pressing on pop-up or background option would enqueue the video ... my suggestion isn't far away from his but more intuitive if that's the right word. Instead of long pressing, a ( + )""plus sign"" or something similar is to be added next to both modes on the right.

The work done in #4425  ""Replace specific enqueue options with one"" could be used to inspire more alternatives. 
#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?

Makes life a little bit easier... but seriously, try enqueueing 5 video yourself in both ways to see the vast difference."

#### Describe the feature you want

I'd like to have an in-app access to background player control.
I've thought about placing it in the three dots menu (where open in browser and settings stand), tell us if you've found a better place, or even create a pull request

On TV there is no way to access notifications. They may popup on the screen if you are on the launcher, but that's it. And there is also no way to access background player controls within the app.

On my tv, the only way to control is to use play / pause / next / previous button, but that's really basic (i.e. I can't see the duration, change speed…) and that may not be the case for everyone.

[This line is the notification click listener to open controls](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/player/BackgroundPlayer.java#L279), it will surely help.

1554;NewPipe merchandise for conferences, developer meetings etc.;open;2018-07-26T19:45:35Z;2018-12-01T12:13:56Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/1554;37;"While working on some merchandise for another project, I thought it was a good idea to create and order some merchandise for NewPipe as well.

Since we have a few great designers in our team, I thought we should ask them to assist with the design.

@theScrabi and I currently plan two articles: we'd like to have some NewPipe stickers with just the logo and the project name, which can be used for laptop lids, etc. Also, we'd like to have some flyers showcasing the NewPipe project, and explaining how people can get involved and contribute.

The formats I have in mind are the following:

 - Flyers: DIN A6, portrait oriented, with a 3mm margin that is cut off during production. The data format is 111x154, end format 105x148. As usual, backgrounds etc. should span over the entire document, i.e., also cover the margin. This is to avoid white space when the flyers are cut to size.
 - Stickers. DIN A8, landscape oriented, with a 3mm margin that is cut off during production. Data format 58x80, end format 52x74. The stickers are produced transparently, any ""white"" in the final format won't be printed. Therefore, shadows etc. are not a good idea.

The material should be quite neutral, i.e., not focus on the conferences we're going to be at, so that we don't have to dispose any of them after the event is over.

We will order some quite large amounts so that we can give them away on conferences team members will visit. If you are a contributor and have a chance to meet with us, please let us know so we can bring some of those materials for you to take with you.

The merchandise articles will be paid for from the donations we received.

For details regarding the printing company, their data format descriptions etc., please contact us on IRC (#NewPipe on Freenode).

@TobiGr if you have some time in the following weeks, I'd appreciate if you could give this a try. I will create some simple designs soon, too, so that we can order at least some material for the upcoming events (e.g., KDE Akademy, FrOSCon). If you don't have time, just let me know so we can focus on my designs then."

I know that this problem will be solved when you implement the possibility to view and search in channel playlists, but I'd like the power to adjust the search results nonetheless.

Currently the results that are displayed use the default filter values, one of which is by order of relevance.

I suppose this isn't really hard to make; mostly adding extra arguments in the search() function in the file YoutubeSearchEngine.java, and a nice UI-component to let the user choose which filters he'd like to use, but I reckon it's not the smallest job ever to be done, especially if you take the time to work out a nice UI solution for this - which isn't easy.

Since I have a rough vision on how to do this, maybe I will be able to find the time during the christmas holidays to do it myself and submit a pull request.

### Feature description

Right now, there is no feature that allows you to permanently set the thumbnail of a playlist.
Such a feature could be introduced by pressing on the three dots in the playlist. There you could have an option to permanently lock the thumbnail. If it is pressed, the thumbnail of the playlist won't change. If you then press ""unlock thumbnail"" (only visible if thumbnail is currently locked) it can be changed again.
If the thumbnail video is not in the playlist anymore the first video gets selected as the new thumbnail video.

### Why do you want this feature?

I want my thumbnail to stay the same for a particular playlist. The current implementation would lead to the playlist thumbnail constantly changing and thus not always being representative of my chosen playlist topic.

### Additional information

I am a developer and would work on this issue myself. "

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.
Example: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*

Optionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.
Example: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->

Currently shuffling all videos of a playlist or an uploader's videos is very hard. We need to click on the ""Play all"" button, start the video to show the episode dropdown menu, click on that menu, click shuffle, then skip to the next video. And we haven't talked about that if the uploader has many videos, only the ones loaded in the list will queue.

I propose lets have a more cleaner UI for channels (as proposed in #5747 and #5746) as well as playlists. And add a shuffle all button that fetches all the videos in a playlist creates a random queue then opens a player.

What happens if there are too much entries should be decided. There could be maybe a warning popup (that can be disabled in the settings preferably) that warns that there are too much entries.

#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.
Example: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->



#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.
Example: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->

Currently the playlist UI looks like this.

And the channel like this.

I think the 3 sections are unnecessary and the separators take up too much space so it should have either a more compact layout or only icons, including a shuffle all icon:

#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?
<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?
The better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.
Example: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->

Easier shuffling, cleaner UI."

<details><summary><b>Implementation details (click to open)</b></summary>
<p>
These are the major parts of this implementation:

**(Meta)-Data**
The metadata of a video contains a new field (the extractor had to be modified for this → https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/pull/647 )
  * This field consists of a list of framesets (yt currently returns 2)
  * The framesets have different preview thumbnail sizes (that's why there exists the option low and high quality in the settings)
  * A frameset has urls to the preview thumbnails; a url returns an (""base"") image with multiple preview thumbnails, e.g.
  ![prev_thumb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40789489/120906651-7f992a80-c65b-11eb-9fc5-1fddc9e661a4.png)

**How it get's into the seekbar**
1. Preparing the data

The metadata is changed in the player, when a new video is played/started.

When this happens the urls get asynchronously fetched and processed, which happens mostly in ``SeekbarPreviewThumbnailHolder``

2. Seekbar positioning

Note: The images from the url are not ""pre-processed"". The extraction of the corresponding preview thumbnail and resizing happens when the seekbar is changed.

When the seekbar is moved the closest image to the current position (in ms) is searched and returned.
If none is found or an error occurs the thumbnail will simply be hidden.

After thumbnail was extracted from/cut out of the ""base"" image (from the url of the frameset) it will also be resized:
The size of the final thumbnail is calculated as follows:
* absolute min-width: 100dp
* (preferred) width: player-width / 4
* absolute max-width: 2.5 times the original width (else it becomes too pixelated)

**Settings**
New option""seekbar thumbnail preview"" (under Settings>Video and audio>Player)
Can contain the following values:
* ""High quality (larger)"" - default
* ""Low quality (smaller)""
* ""Don't show"" (a thumbnail)

The settings will be applied when the next video is started / opened or more specific when the metadata of the player is changed

### Due diligence
- [x] I read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Things that should be checked 👁️‍🗨️ 
#### Technical
I implemented these changes as good as i could think of.
However there the following topics/parts of the code should be checked carefully by the reviewers, because if it fails it may cause excessive problems:
* thread management (a relatively simple ExecutorService is currently used, maybe there are better ways)
* handling of the bitmaps (check for memory leaks)
* Check the thumbnail showing logic / calculation where the seekbar preview container (thumbnail + currentTime) should be 

#### Other behaviors and implementations that should be looked upon
* The resizing of the thumbnail logic - I tested that on ""normal"" devices (Google Pixel 3a emulated), maybe some devices like tablets or TVs respond differently and the thumbnail is too small or large

### Affected version

0.23.2

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Open NewPipe, and attempt to play any video from your feed.

### Expected behavior

The video loads, and plays

### Actual behavior

Comments and their avatars are loading, however the video preview remains black, and the description is stuck loading with a spinning wheel.

### Screenshots/Screen recordings

_No response_

### Logs

_No response_

### Affected Android/Custom ROM version

Android 10 / OxygenOS 10.0.1

### Affected device model

OnePlus 5

### Additional information

Videos and their descriptions were loading and playing perfectly yesterday, hence why I'm tempted to think this may be an API/parsing issue. I've cleared NewPipe's cache and restarted the app, but am hesitant to wipe the app's data if I don't need to..."

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR replaces the outdated [Android-Universal-Image-Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader) (which has not had any new release in the last 6 years) with the more stable and updated [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso). This hopefully fixes a [nasty unfixed issue](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader/issues/908) in Android-Universal-Image-Loader that was causing #4638. Also, the loading seems smoother to me, and retrieving images from memory cache is now instant, instead of taking a couple of milliseconds (try scrolling fast up and down after all thumbnails have been loaded).
I also added a switch in the *debug* settings to enable [indicators](https://square.github.io/picasso/static/debug.png).

Fixes #4638

It would only contain updating the extractor version and fixing things if the public API of the extractor changes. No bugfixes specific to NewPipe and not NewPipeExtractor.
Unless there are major changes in the extractor this would be ok for me since i plan to use it myself.

### Version
- NewPipe 0.19.3 (Autoupdate version)
- Xiaomi Mi 9 Lite, Android 10, MIUI 11.0.2

### Steps to reproduce the bug
1. Open any video... i tested with different videos from different channels, all of them with this issue.

<!-- If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug. -->

### Expected behavior
The video plays normally, with the audio in sync (Tested today with 0.19.2).

### Actual behaviour
The video plays normally, but looking carefully, the video and audio began to go out of sync slowly (with video first). In 10-15 minutes the sync is between half second and a second, but in 3-5 minutes it is very noticiable.
If you choose any other resolution, move the scroll time, rewind or forward, the video and audio come again in sync, and it began slowly to lost sync again.
This happens with 0.19.3, i uninstall and installed 0.19.2, and this is not happening with that version.

### Screenshots/Screen recordings
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or a screen recording to help explain your problem. GitHub supports uploading them directly in the issue text box. If your file is too big for Github to accept, feel free to paste a link from an image/video hoster here instead. -->

<!-- The comments between these brackets won't show up in the submitted issue (as you can see in the Preview). -->

### Checklist
<!-- The first box has been checked for you to show you how it is done. -->

- [x] I am using the latest version - 0.20.1 <!-- Check https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases -->
- [x] I checked, but didn't find any duplicates (open OR closed) of this issue in the repo. <!-- Seriously, check. O_O -->
- [x] I have read the contribution guidelines given at https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [x] This issue contains only one bug. I will open one issue for every bug report I want to file.

### Steps to reproduce the bug
<!--
1. Go to '...'
2. Press on '....'
3. Swipe down to '....'
-->
1. Search the concerned video like 'Hello World'.
2. Enqueue in the background
3. Open the video. 
(Both the cases 2. and 3. produce the similar behaviour)

<!-- If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug. -->



### Actual behaviour
<!-- Tell us what happens with the steps given above. -->The video or audio(when playing in background) starts playing, the screen starts flickering , in the sense that display gets on and off , flickers for some time displaying the messege -- 'System UI keeps stopping' (giving two options -- app info or close app). The app gets closed for the latter option, but if pressed anywhere else on the screen the video plays continuosly with audio, screen flickering for some time and then phone gets restarted.




### Expected behavior
<!-- Tell us what you expect to happen. -->
The video to be played till the end.

810;Some Playback Enhancements;closed;2017-11-04T03:52:09Z;2017-11-12T21:01:40Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/810;34;"- ~~Added ability to start playing directly from info item list view through action dropdown: now you can binge through your favourite channel.~~ Postponed until a better UI comes up.
- Added play buttons to channel fragment.
- Added popup player tossing when flung with weaker strength (useful for getting the popup out of keyboard's way).
- Modified background notification to display seeking buttons when play queue has only 1 item, per @SpajicM's request.
- Modified service player activity scrolling to be instant when the distance between the currently viewing and playing is too far apart.
- Fixed track progress reset when shuffle is clicked in quick succession. 
- Fixed NPE when service player activity UI is touched during service shutdown."
680;[Ready] Play Queue;closed;2017-09-08T05:29:42Z;2017-10-31T12:24:47Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/680;34;"Play Queue is now feature complete. No future updates or bugfixes will be pushed to this branch, unless there is a feature breaking bug or requested change. Continued development will go on a separate branch: [play-queue-enhancement](https://github.com/karyogamy/NewPipe/tree/play-queue-enhancement).

Features:
- [x] Gapless playback for both audio and video play queues
- [x] Play queue controls: Select, Move, Remove, Enqueue, Shuffle
- [x] Play queue menu for background and popup video player (click on notification)
- [x] VLC-style play queue for main video player
- [x] Enabled tunneling for HDR (only if both device AND codec is capable)
- [x] Enabled integration with system-wide sound effects (DSP)
- [x] Persistent quality selection in player
- [x] Hold button to enqueue stream on detail page

Start a play queue by going into any playlist fragments:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/32148299-001bac62-bcb2-11e7-9499-23344660ac48.png"" width=""200"">

A quick overview of the design (final):

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5570482/32148316-3e85e292-bcb2-11e7-8d6c-e155737b89a9.jpg"" width=""500"">

Because NewPipe allows multiple players to co-exist as services, each player contains its own play queue. This also means all players now handles only playlists and single streams are now playlists of one item. 

Each play queue keeps track of the queue and current index state and broadcast any changes to the states. Play queue has different implementations that expose methods to fetch more items if incomplete.

MediaSourceManager is used to react to the changes in play queue and reflect them on Exoplayer's dynamic playlist. With the new dynamic concatenating media source provided by the recent Exoplayer update, streams are now seemless during transition (if buffered). 

By baking StreamInfoItem into a custom MediaSource, we now have much better control over loading StreamInfo and Exoplayer's dynamic playlist. This is done so each MediaSource can be individually prepared on-demand through calls from MediaSourceManager. This reduces the amount of bandwidth when loading while still enjoying the gapless capability from ExoPlayer.

Current tasks:
- Waiting for code review and merge

Reserved as separate PR:
- Local Playlist
- Watch history entry for playlist streams
- Fix intent too large when passing play queue
- Pitch dropdown to main video player"

6537;Add support for delivery methods other than progressive HTTP (in the player only);closed;2021-06-20T17:59:59Z;2022-07-08T20:46:07Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/6537;33;"#### What is it?
- [x] Bugfix (user facing)
- [x] Feature (user facing)
- [ ] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR adds support of YouTube OTF streams and the full support of ended livestreams in NewPipe (these streams cannot be downloaded or played in external players right now).
It also fixes the seek of PeerTube streams which have HLS-only variants of streams.
The support for downloading these streams **will be not added in this PR**.

Some code is inspired from #3803. 

For more detailed changes, check the commits.

**TO DO:**
- [x] Fix the crash when pressing the Download button (`IndexOutOfBoundsException`);
- [x] Add a method in `ListHelper` to return only streams which have a delivery method (for e.g. return only HLS streams for PeerTube videos in the player)
- [ ] Use the `PROGRESSIVE_HTTP` delivery method for external players when possible and add ability to play other variants of streams in these players
- [x] Support HLS ""raw"" manifests (the manifests which are returned by the extractor and not the URLs of HLS manifests) (if ExoPlayer supports them) (thanks to @Redirion for this).

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
- Fixes #2415
- Fixes #6860 (some audio streams were recognized as video streams causing a crash in `ListHelper.compareVideoStreamResolution(String res1, String res2)` which is caught in this PR. The original error cause was also fixed in the extractor.)

#### Relies on the following changes
- TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor#663

#### APK testing 
On the website the APK can be found by going to the ""Checks"" tab below the title and then on ""artifacts"" on the right.

#### Due diligence
- [x] I read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)."

2882;YouTube-like UI;closed;2019-12-20T13:17:51Z;2020-08-01T10:53:20Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2882;33;"Hello, guys. I'm making Youtube-like page for viewing videos. So will be possible to watch a video, to read comments and to see related videos on the same page. I already did this job previously in #834 and used that version since February 2018 (and it still works fine with some changes of extractor). I couldn't find common ground with contributors of NewPipe in 2018 so this will be a new beginning for us. 

This issue is for tracking progress and for exchange of ideas. 

I'm planning to:
- include a video inside a view that already contains comments, description, etc
- remove app bar from the top of the view
- place a three dot button and share button inside the video itself
- unify all players into one logical class (main player, background player, popup in one place) so you will be able to switch between players instantly without loosing playback progress
- make the whole video fragment hidable via gesture like Android version of Youtube
- make possible to view the description and comments in fullscreen mode like desktop version of YouTube. 


If you have ideas or improvements over the list of tasks you read just tell me here."
2668;Account/Cloud sync support;closed;2019-09-28T03:08:18Z;2020-05-08T20:05:41Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/2668;33;"- [x] I carefully read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and agree to them.

This PR adds an option to create newpipe account on server and sync subscriptions, playlists, etc.
Backend code - https://github.com/yausername/newpipe-sync-server

- Login is optional, app will work as usual if one chooses to skip login.
- Latest data is fetched from server on login.
- Data can be updated using pull down to refresh in `BookmarkFragment, SubscriptionFragment, LocalPlaylistFragment, StatisticsPlaylistFragment`
- Data is encrypted before it is sent to server. So the server has no knowledge of your data. It only knows the ciphertext.
- There is no way to recover data is one forgets password.
- Changing password is hard, since all the existing data has to be re-encrypted.
- I will add more information here





**Disclaimer: This is a draft implementation. This is expected to be buggy and might contain some security/crypto related bugs as well. Your local data (of debug app) will be erased if you choose to login.**

2414;Support for Channel Tabs;open;2019-06-21T11:07:14Z;2023-08-03T12:14:41Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2414;33;"The channel page, in my opinion, is incredibly weak. It lacks a few key features that allow for sorting, filtering, and seeing curated content from a particular channel.

In my opinion, the channel page should eventually host at least the following features:   
- Search content/playlists/albums uploaded by a channel   
- View a Channels Tabs (Videos/Playlists/About/Affiliated Channels/Community) (Referenced in #2409)

If this is considered, I also believe the 'About' and 'Affiliated Channels' pages could be combined.

6486;doesn't build reproducibly (due to bug in coreLibraryDesugaring);closed;2021-06-14T23:25:13Z;2023-01-24T21:05:24Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/6486;32;"I compared the APKs from the last 5 releases on GitHub to the APKs built and published by F-Droid.
Some of them are identical (apart from the signature), but not all of them are.

I've done multiple clean builds of `0.21.4`; they were not always identical.
I've seen 3 variants, one identical to the GitHub APK, another identical to the F-Droid APK.
The differences I've seen were always in `j$/util/Collection$-EL.class`.

5187;Fix crash when no default browser is set and improve share dialogs (on some devices);closed;2020-12-15T19:33:39Z;2021-01-16T16:14:45Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/5187;32;"#### What is it?

- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR

#### General description of the changes
This PR improves sharing content to other apps with the following changes:

- fix crash when no browser is set on some devices (NewPipe thinks that the system app chooser is a browser because its package ID isn't ""android"" due to some OEM's system customizations)
- try to use Android's system share sheet instead of OEM's share sheet (this last is used as a fallback if this first was removed) for:
  - share content in clipboard (playlists, videos, tracks, channels and bug reports)
  - open content in browser (playlists, videos, tracks, channels, report on GitHub in bug reports options and comments, install a player prompts) where there is no default app
  - open a video stream / an audio stream in a external player where there is no default app
- fix double toast `Copied to clipboard` shown when copying formatted report in crash report activity

#### Code changes
- catch ActivityNotFoundException when opening an URL or a file if it's a chooser
- add openFileInApp method in ShareUtils to be able to open streams in external app / downloads in default app or in the app chooser
- edit getDefaultAppPackageName method of ShareUtils to be able to return default app for opening downloads, streams, or URLs
- use ShareUtils.openFileInApp for downloads / playing streams in external player
- use ShareUtils.shareUrl for sharing crash report from ErrorActivity to other apps and for sharing a stream in the play queue
- use ShareUtils.openUrlInBrowser when tap ""Install"" button from install VLC and install Kore dialogs
- use an ACTION_CHOOSER intent and putting as an extra intent the ACTION_SEND intent to share downloads
- add a string open_with in English and French which is used for Android's system chooser title
- add / edit comments and change JavaDocs for remembering that ""android"" package isn't returned when no default app on some devices
- also indent checkstyle-suppressions.xml file

Here is the difference between the original code and my changes (my device is an Honor 9X, running EMUI 10):

#### What I changed to do this
The trick to do this is to use an ACTION_CHOOSER intent and put the share intent (ACTION_SEND) or the view intent (ACTION_VIEW) as an extra intent.
Note also if Android's system chooser (in the intent ACTION_CHOOSER) has been directly modified by the OEM, this PR will not change it.

#### A few note about UX
With my changes, we can't choose which app to always open an intent but only choose for once (if there isn't a default app).

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
Fixes #3925

5148;Show improved error panel instead of annoying snackbar or crashing ;closed;2020-12-11T14:36:39Z;2021-03-14T17:02:11Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/5148;32;"#### What is it?
- [x] Bugfix (user facing)
- [ ] Feature (user facing)
- [x] Codebase improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
This PR improves the error panel that currently is only shown when there are network problems:
- When ANY error occours, if there are not already some items in the view, always show the error panel, otherwise show the snackbar.
- Extractor errors now don't crash the app but instead show up in the error panel for the corresponding fragment.
- The retry button is always shown except for `ContentNotSupportedException`s and `ContentNotAvailableException`s, like before.
- Add a dynamic button to the error panel that acts as a ""Report"" button for everything except `ReCaptchaException`s, where instead a ""Solve"" button is shown.

I also refactored many things related to error reporting, in particular:
- Move everything inside `error` subpackage.
- Add `ErrorPanelHelper` class to handle the error panel.
- Use `ErrorInfo` to store ALL of the information about an error that is needed to perform a report, so that functions can just take an `ErrorInfo` instead of having to do multiple overloads. This reduced and simplified much the code.
- Remove multiple overloadable functions about errors in `BaseStateFragment` and instead make only one, that handles the error panel by itself. 
- Remove `returnActivity` for `ErrorActivity`: it was only used in `SettingsFragment`s (set to `SettingsActivity`, but without it everything just works as intended) and in `RouterActivity` (set to `MainActivity`: when something failed while resolving a shared link, the error activity shows up, but now when the user presses back he is just brought to what he was doing before sharing the link to NewPipe, which is expected, instead of unexpectedly going to NewPipe's `MainActivity`). Also remove `ActivityCommunicator`, now unneded as it was only needed to pass returnActivity around. **This solves the ""lost backstack"" issue** when the error activity opens, so that the user can report something and then continue browsing without losing anything. @opusforlife2 :-D

Other relevant changes:
- Fix list fragments not being scrollable when the recycler view is hidden, causing problems in `VideoDetailFragment`. Now, instead of hiding, alpha is just set to `0.0f`.
- Fix `EmptyFragment` not being scrollable inside `VideoDetailFragment`.
- Restore error state in `onResume`, i.e. after a fragment was paused.
- Fix `SearchFragment` `onResume` behaviour, that was accidentally showing suggestion and meta info panels from the previous search for a brief moment even though it was asked to load something else.
- Some random code refactorings here and there.

#### TODO
- [x] Add screenshots to this PR
- [x] Fix tests
- [x] Fix comments tab with visible error panel not scrolling in video detail fragment 
- [x] Fix search fragment error panel not being restored after resume
- [x] Test thoroughly <sub>(I tested on my Fairphone with /e/, Android 10. These changes should be device independent)</sub>

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
Fixes #4026
Closes #5359 (becomes not relevant)

#### APK testing 
Do you like this behaviour, instead of the old one where the app crashed clearing activity stack and with annoying snackbars preventing access to comments?
This apk throws random errors every once in a while on network requests, to make testing simpler: [app-debug.zip](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/files/5823020/app-debug.zip)

#### Describe the feature you want
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.
Example: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*

Optionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.
Example: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->
Although after merging #4425 (Replace specific enqueue options with one done by @vkay94 ) made enqueueing videos alot easier, one key change that was needed was overlooked, that is the ability to start  play/enqueue videos from the middle of playlist.

Edit (Dec 10):
- play from here         : starts a new queue
- enqueue from here : adds to existing queue if any


#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.
Example: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->
The problem is if you want to start  playing/enqueue videos from the middle of a playlist, you can't. you can use a work around which is start playing in background/pup-up mode then change to full screen mode however that not right. or you can enqueue videos, one by one, which is not practical especially in big playlists to say the least.


#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.
Example: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->
I wish if we could add to context menu:
- Start playing from here and
- Enqueue from here when a video is playing

Some even insist on updating the app. You cannot continue otherwise.

I am using NewPipe by downloading the latest from ""Github releases"". Sadly it doesn't auto update. Usually I check manually for a new version when Youtube changed something and NewPipe is consequently broken.

Automatic updates would be really helpful.

**Feature request/ idea**

Currently, F-Droid takes too long to update its repo with the latest version of the app. Also, there must be users who don't have/ want F-Droid installed but still want to track the latest version of NewPipe. 

For these users and to counter the slowness of F-Droid APK updates, I suggest that we have an inbuilt system in the app which shows and notifies the availability of the latest APKs. We can use the [Releases API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/) to get the latest info from github itself. 

I'm willing to take up this task if the general idea is approved.

This is a discussion on search and filter UI based on the work and discussion from https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/pull/124

@Bluesir9 @theScrabi Here are my ideas for the search and filter UI. I think it is better to put this into the app repo, because UI discussions do not belong into the extractor repo. I tried to explain briefly, what my intentions and ideas were to make the benefits and disadvantages a bit clearer.

-----

TLDR; you can find the drafts at the end. It might  be good to take a look at them before reading the text so the text is better understandable.

-----

First of all, there were some things to consider before taking a look at the actual design.

NewPipe downloads a complete website for each search. That's why, I decided to make the filters directly visible, so people can see and change them __before performing the search__. This should be quite time and data saving.
Nevertheless, I am not that happy with the current position of the filter bar. While typing the search suggestions change and should help the user to suggest the search query he is looking for. Therefore, the filter bar seems to be ""in the way"" - just like a visual barrier. I considered to place the bar at the bottom of the screen. But this was also quite annoying, because the keyboard needs much space and the filter bar seems to be lost down there. Do you have any suggestions where to put it instead?

Because I decided to show the filters, I needed to group them, otherwise the bar contains too much info at once and is messy. Fortunately, the filters are already grouped by YouTube. Displaying text is a bad thing as it a) needs to be translated and b) people need way more time to read a text compared to see and understand an icon. Icons are intuitive and can be recognized later on. The difficult part here was to find icons which match the meaning of a group. I could not decided which icon to use for the `duration` category. I'd say, I prefer the clock icon above the timer because it matches with the two filters best. In other words, the disabled state looks quite similar to the to other states (`short` and `long`).

Apropos __state__. I didn't mention it before, so I do now. In the filter bar, there are five icons, each for one category. Most categories allow only one of their filters to be applied at a time. For example, the type category has six states: `video`, `channel`, `playlist`, `movie`, `show` and `disabled / inactive` (currently represented in NewPipe by `all`). Filtering by `all` and `video` is not possible. The second idea behind showing the filters in the bar represented by icons is to display their current state. This means, we replace the category icon when a filter is selected.. This needs  a bunch of icons which represent the active filter. For most filters, good icons already exist (e.g. `video`, `channel`, `playlist`, `thumb up` for `best rated` etc.) and are easy to find. 
But finding good icons for the `upload date` and `features` groups drove me crazy.
I couldn't find a way to abstract their filters without using numbers and letters. My decision is to represent the times by using the calendar and putting the time into it (see below). 
There are too many `features` and in difference to all the other categories YouTube allows to apply multiple feature filters. Therefore we need to handle them different to the others.

For the ""normal"" categories I suggest to show a normal dialog containing the icon and filter name whereas the feature filter needs a bit more work. There are eleven feature filters provided by YouTube. I am not sure how many we want to show (We could either show all and ignore that our players do not support all features yet and provide the download of the videos so the user can an an other player, or just reduce the list to those filter which are supported by exoplayer).

Nevertheless, we need a different UI, because the single click dialogs are quite nonfunctional for this purpose. All together I needed to decided between two concepts: display the features as ""badge"" / ""chip"" or use the settings style with a toggle.
One one hand, we can put the chips after selecting them right into the filter bar. This allows the user to still see all applied filters. As said above, I'd like to achieve this behaviour. As a bonus, users are able to remove the filter chip with ony one click/touch. The big questions is how to select the chips. The [material guidelines for chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html#filter-chips) suggest to use horizontal scrolling whenever the chips need more than two rows, because otherwise the screen looks quite messy. However, I think we can ignore this suggestion when we use a blank fragment to select the chips from and group then in a smart way.
On the other hand, we do not need to show the currently applied feature filters in the filter bar. This allows us to not use chips to select the filters. I think it is not intuitive to use setting-like toggles to enable something which than appears as a chip somewhere else.
I'd like to go with the chips, but am open to your feedback, which is btw. appreciated to all things here, but in particular to this topic.

Just my two cents regarding the __type filter__: Apart from the video, channel and playlist filter, we can now support the movie and show filter. We might consider to disable the movie filter in the app, because the extractor currently does only render the `video-render` objects, but not `movie-render` objects. Nevertheless, movies need do be purchased, a login is therefore required. So the movie filter might not bring the expected results because only free ""movies"", which are uploaded as video, are shown in the results.

### General filter UI and behaviour
We can also put the feature filters into a new row instead of appending them.

1448;Proper Feed UI;closed;2018-06-03T20:00:58Z;2022-05-02T19:08:17Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/1448;30;"[![Bountysource](https://api.bountysource.com/badge/issue?issue_id=49721213)](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/49721213-subscription-order?utm_source=49721213&utm_medium=shield&utm_campaign=ISSUE_BADGE)

So guys I promised that I would think about a proper way of implementing feeds for subscriptions.

Here is my suggestion.

## The subscription Window

![feed_channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/40890240-44584004-6773-11e8-806a-53474c0a443f.png)

Like in a typical RSS app you would see the new/unseen videos of a channel by an Indicator in each item.

## The Feed Window

![feed_screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/40890247-6f9275d2-6773-11e8-8d85-b5df0ad5441c.png)

- Sorted by time ;D
- Shows __all__ the new/unseen videos of a channel not just the newsest one

## Channel Window

![highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/40890366-255e9944-6775-11e8-90cb-d026b58712f5.png)

New Videos of a subscribed channel will be highlighted.

# Bonus goodies

- Notifying the user if a new video is available.

# How it's done

Believe it or not, but some preparation work has already been done regarding this topic ;)

### Preparations on the Database
So when @karyogamy  designed the Database he created the two tables [Stream](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/database/stream/dao/StreamDAO.java) and [StreamHistory](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/database/history/dao/StreamHistoryDAO.java).  By applying __``Stream \ StreamHistory``__ you can find the so called Orphanes. These are streams that are not yet in the history but still listed in the streams table. @karyogamy  Maybe these can be used to indicate not yet seen videos.

### Preperations on detecting the time
Since time on youtube videos is a little complicated to parse the NewPipe Extractor always returned the creation time of a video as a String not as a number. This however makes it complicated if you want to track the time for a feed database. Luckily @mauriciocolli created the [time ago parser](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/tree/master/timeago-parser) project with which is possible to convert the Youtube time ago strings into rough time estimations.

Also for some youtube channels a RSS feed is available, however wee still need a fallback because not all channels have RSS.

### What still needs to be done
- [x] Well the extractor still returns a String for the time, so the time ago parser should be used for youtube to return a `long` instead.
- [x] The [StreamEntity](https://github.com/teamnewpipe/newpipe/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/database/stream/model/StreamEntity.java) needs to get a row with the creation date."

147;Tor leaking;closed;2016-01-07T18:53:46Z;2020-05-09T06:40:15Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/147;30;"I noticed traffic isn't routed through Tor correctly. (Yes, I enabled it in settings)
To prevent leaking I dissallow direct internet acces to applications that are supposed to use Tor ensuring the only way it can access the internet is through the Orbot app.
But I noticed that as soon as I block internet access to Newpipe it no longer loads meaning it isn't using Orbots proxy.

Someone with more expertise should probably have a look at this. If this is in fact the case we might need to temporarily remove the feature untill it is fixed. Now users might believe their traffic is secure but really it isn't.

### Feature description

The interface here have option to adjust tempo and pitch but they have a flat text based layout instead of some kind of clickable buttons. With little bit of design change there, we can know visualize much better as for now they just look like video statistics menu.

### Why do you want this feature?

To enhance the visibility of the tempo and pitch functions giving users the ability to differentiate with ease by having more understanding about the app usability.

### Additional information

Just a simple layout change can do wonders for users. Below is just an example.

#### What feature do you want?
<!-- Explain how you want the app's look or behavior to change to suit your needs. -->
I would like the option to ""always display"" the progress bar so that the progress bar is always visible on the video throughout playback.  Currently, the progress bar disappears after 2-3 seconds.  This feature would be a ui option that can be turned on or off based on personal preference by each user so that once enabled or disabled it will repeat the same behavior automatically for every video.

#### Why do you want this feature?
<!-- Describe any problem or limitation you come across while using the app which would be solved by this feature. -->
I would like this feature so that the progress bar remains on screen as a visual representation of the time remaining in each video without having to continually tap the screen to see the progress bar and the amount of time remaining in the video."

3271;Use vector drawables instead of PNGs for material icons;closed;2020-03-25T15:26:20Z;2022-08-04T09:47:01Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3271;29;"### What is it?
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] Feature
- [x] Enhancement under the hood

### Long description of the changes in your PR
For all manually-created images PNG have been kept. Debug apk size decreased by 232,030 bytes.
- Rename all icon attrs to have a **`ic_` prefix**
- Always use **`_24dp` icons**, because there is no real difference, since they are vector drawables
- Always use the **original name found on material.io for icon** drawables, as to not create confusion and possibly duplicates. Icon names can still be different from real drawable names, though I have made some of them compliant to this or maybe more meaningul.
- Use standard icons for **`expand_more` and `expand_less`** instead of triangles
- Use `play_button_outline` instead of custom PNG as **play button in VideoDetailFragment** (questionable, as there is no shadow anymore)
- **Replace the search-insert-icon** (on the button that is right to every search suggestion, and when pressed replaces what is in the search field with the value of that suggestion), that was an arrow pointing up-left and didn't have a meaning, with a custom hand-made icon (`ic_search_add`)
- Keep `ic_close` and `ic_replay` as PNGs: needed for notifications in RemoteViews

Other changes:
- Remove duplicate `getIconByAttr()` in ThemeHelper (use `resolveResourceIdFromAttr()` instead)
- Improve the **VideoDetailFragment layout** by a little by forcing the ""expand description"" icon to always stay in the same place even after expanding. I tested the new layout on various screens and it always looked ok.
- **Update AndroidX** to `1.1.0` to fix icon crashes in preferences on API 19: use `androidx.preference:preference` instead of `androidx.legacy:legacy-preference-v14`
- **Remove legacy libraries** (`androidx.legacy:legacy-support-v4`): this made no effect, and allowed me not to use `androidx.appcompat.widget.*` everywhere, tested on various Android versions
- Fix `SelectChannelFragment` and `SelectKioskFragment` (those used to set main screen tabs): in API 19 they had a **duplicate title** always empty.
- Fix pause icon used instead of play when seeking in a paused popup player

### Fixes the following issue(s)
- Fixes #1199

### Testing apk
Tested thoroughly on API 19 (Galaxy Nexus (small screen) and Pixel 3 XL (big screen) emulators on Android 4.4), on API 24 (native on Huawei P9 Lite with Android 7.0), on API 29 (Pixel 3 XL emulator on Android 10). Though I'm not entirely sure I have explored every single piece of the app, so I'd like @Domiuns and @AnotherLife to test it, too, on Android 4.4 ;-)

Being able to switch from video play to background seems like a very useful option to me, especially for music playback. Also, this feature was requested in #704 .

While it works as intended, I would appreciate some tips design wise:
- [ ] Existing audio icon seems slightly too big.
- [ ] We are already cutting the video title alot, is there any other placement for video options, maybe under the title or some drop down menu?

It's possible to convert to local playlist a youtube playlist, but the content is limited to local loaded items

- [X] I made sure that there are *no existing issues* - [open](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues) or [closed](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) - which I could contribute my information to.

- [X] I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Affected version

0.23.0

### Steps to reproduce the bug

Just watch any video on app. It buffers continuously ruining user experience.

Pro tip: To reproduce the bug easily, increase the time speed to 2x and above. I watch videos using 2.25x speed. Even though it buffers at 1x it's easier to notice the stutter at high timespeed.


### Expected behavior

The video should load seamlessly without any buffers.

### Actual behavior

The video buffers after 20 to 30 sec intervals. I have a stable internet and youtube app or website works fine. But Newpipe buffers. Normally, while watching YouTube my internet speed is bout 1 mbps+ however after the latest update it averages bout 250 kbps and peaking at 500 kpbs.



### Screenshots/Screen recordings

_No response_

### Logs

_No response_

### Affected Android/Custom ROM version

Android 10/ MIUI 12

### Affected device model

Redmi 8

### Additional information

I have downgraded to 0.22.2 version. All buffering problems is solved. I think the bug is isolated to latest version (0.23.0). 
My speed also shows promising results of 1.5 mbps whereas it showed peaks of 500 kbps at latest version"

Successor to #5850 (please take a look at that PR for the basic description).

This is a new PR because it's not possible for a maintainer to modify the old one and I otherwise had to request so many tiny changes which would not be easily doable.

TL;DR - changes on top:
* Fixed/Reformatted code
* Refactored UI in the background (nearly looks the same)
* Some minor fixes (theme not working etc)

4259;Add settings migration, improve share dialog and minimize to background by default;closed;2020-09-09T19:27:37Z;2020-09-27T14:07:48Z;https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4259;28;"#### What is it?

- [ ] Code base improvement (dev facing)
- [ ] Meta improvement to the project (dev facing)

#### Description of the changes in your PR
The difference between ""detail page"" and the video player is only the phone's orientation. Therefore, we decided to remove the open ""Detail Page"" option from the share menu. To handle entries from older versions, I added a migration system for the settings / shared preferences which is quite similar to the one used in for the DB.
With the new app workflow introduced by the unified player PR, it is possible to minimize the video player to the bottom while doing other stuff in the app. However, this does only apply to the main fragment. When a user opens the settings or the about screen, the player stops. That's bad UX. For this reason, I set the ""Minimize on app switch"" setting to ""background"" instead of ""None"" to allow seamless transitions within the app as well as when closing NewPipe.

#### Fixes the following issue(s)
<!-- Also add reddit or other links which are relevant to your change. -->
Closes #4070

#### Testing apk

###### note: I did not have much time for testing. 
Please install the current dev version from the zip first and change the ""Minimize on app switch"" setting or keep it as it is to see if the migration works when updating with the other APK.

@wb9688 It's a great idea to add SoundCloud to NewPipe! Thank's for your work.
> Btw do we already have ideas for NewPipe's GUI? I was thinking about something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/CbAfzsC.gifv).

Since tabs will be introduced with TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#620 soon, another bar on the top of the screen doesn't seem to be a good solution to me. I thought a little about this problem and found two possible solutions:

1. **Refactor the search filter menu:** remove the old list and add clickable items. This gives the user the possibility to search for things in Youtube _and_ SoundCloud at the same time.

First sketch: default search bar Second sketch: Search bar after clicking on the filter icon (maybe the filter icon should not disappear to be accessible for further actions). The clickable items should have different background colors depending on their state.

2. **Add navigation drawer to app:** replace the old menu in the app bar by a navigation drawer. This solution gives the app a more modern look and separates all services.
